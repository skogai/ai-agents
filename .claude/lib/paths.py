"""Vendor-portable path resolution for skill scripts (Issue #2050).

Skills that ship in a vendored plugin install (Copilot CLI and similar
harnesses) cannot assume the consumer repo has a `.claude/` directory or
the upstream `.agents/` tree. This module centralizes the two resolution
policies every skill needs so no script hard-codes an upstream-only path.

Two policies:

- `resolve_skill_resource(skill, relpath)` is the READ path. It locates a
  file that ships inside the plugin (a reference doc, a helper script). This
  helper uses this local candidate order:
    1. `${COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<skill>/<relpath>` or
       `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<skill>/<relpath>` when set by the harness.
    2. `.claude/skills/<skill>/<relpath>` resolved from the current working
       directory (Claude Code project layout).
    3. `skills/<skill>/<relpath>` resolved relative to the plugin install
       root discovered by walking up from this file to the
       `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` marker (vendored install).
  Returns the first candidate that exists, else None. Read-only: it never
  creates anything.

- `resolve_artifact_root(subdir, base=None)` is the WRITE path. Skills write
  artifacts to a consumer-side location, defaulting to `<cwd>/.agents/<subdir>`.
  The directory is created lazily (parents=True, exist_ok=True). A caller that
  already knows the repository root (for example a session script that resolved
  it from git) passes it as `base` so the artifact anchors at
  `<base>/.agents/<subdir>` instead of the current working directory. The root
  is overridable by the `AI_AGENTS_ARTIFACT_ROOT` environment variable so a
  consumer can redirect every skill's output to one place; the override wins
  over both `base` and the cwd default.

Relationship to existing skills:
  The read path uses a three-location fallback like `/review`, but the
  environment variable and concrete resource paths are local to this helper.
  `/review` documents `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` for its first candidate. This helper
  uses `COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT` or `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` because packaged plugin
  installs expose the plugin root, not one skill directory. The write path is
  new (the `/review` skill has no write artifact), modeled on `/spec` Step 0 writing
  `.agents/metrics/STEP-0-METRICS.md` lazily under the consumer cwd. The
  AI_AGENTS_ARTIFACT_ROOT override is added so the consumer, not the skill,
  owns the artifact location.

Related sources: `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md`, section "Path resolution
(harness-agnostic)". Plugin-root marker reuse:
`.claude/lib/bootstrap.py::resolve_plugin_lib_dir` (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT then
the `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` walk-up). This file is a sibling write-path
resolver to that read-path resolver per the Issue #2050 batch decision.
