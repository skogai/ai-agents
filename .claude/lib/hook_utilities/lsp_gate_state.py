"""Canonical: scripts/hook_utilities/lsp_gate_state.py. Sync via scripts/sync_plugin_lib.py.

Ported from the claude-code-lsp-enforcement-kit (nesaminua, MIT, v2.3.2),
files ``kit/hooks/lsp-usage-tracker.js`` and ``kit/hooks/lsp-session-reset.js``.
This is the ONLY stateful module in the LSP-gate library: the PostToolUse
tracker writes it, the SessionStart reset clears it, and the PreToolUse guards
only read it (ADR-062 Section 4, single system-of-record).

State lives OUTSIDE the git working tree in a user-scoped directory, keyed by
``hashlib.sha256(cwd).hexdigest()[:16]``. A missing or unreadable state file is
treated as "needs warmup" and never raises (fail-open). Gate-state is not a
security boundary (CWE-284, Low): tampering degrades to allowing the raw tool.

Canonical kit state shape (``lsp-usage-tracker.js:87-89``), quoted
character-for-character (canonical-source-mirror.md):

    const existing = readFlag(flagPath) || {
      cwd: process.cwd(), warmup_done: false, nav_count: 0, read_count: 0, read_files: [],
    };

Canonical kit warmup-then-nav increment (``lsp-usage-tracker.js:91-99``):

    if (!existing.warmup_done) {
      existing.warmup_done = true;
      existing.cold_start_retries = 0;
    } else {
      existing.nav_count = (existing.nav_count || 0) + 1;
    }
    existing.timestamp = Date.now();
    existing.last_tool = toolName;

Canonical kit thresholds (``lsp-first-read-guard.js:30-32``):

    const FREE_READS = 2;
    const WARN_AT = 3;
    const REQUIRE_NAV_2_AT = 6;

Canonical kit flag path scheme (``lsp-usage-tracker.js:21-27``):

    const STATE_DIR = path.join(os.homedir(), '.claude', 'state');
    const cwd = process.cwd();
    const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(cwd).digest('hex').slice(0, 12);
    return path.join(STATE_DIR, `lsp-ready-${hash}`);

Stricter/looser/different than canonical
----------------------------------------
- DIFFERENT hash: the kit keys the flag with ``md5(cwd).slice(0, 12)``. ADR-062
  Section 4 mandates ``hashlib.sha256(cwd).hexdigest()[:16]`` (md5 is forbidden;
  not a security control but the ADR fixes the scheme). This port uses sha256.
- DIFFERENT state dir: the kit writes ``~/.claude/state``. ADR-062 Section 4
  mandates a user-scoped dir OUTSIDE the git working tree, never committed. This
  port uses ``$XDG_STATE_HOME/ai-agents-lsp-gate`` when set, else
  ``~/.cache/ai-agents-lsp-gate`` (kept off ``~/.claude`` so plugin state and
  gate state do not collide).
- DIFFERENT threshold name: the kit's ``REQUIRE_NAV_2_AT = 6`` gate fires at the
  6th read. ADR-062 Section 3 sets ``nav_required = 2`` for the Surgical
  threshold and ``WARN_AT = 3``; the hard block ramps at read 4+ with
  ``nav_count < nav_required``. This port exposes ``NAV_REQUIRED = 2``,
  ``FREE_READS = 2``, ``WARN_AT = 3`` as the canonical names the guards consume;
  the per-tier decision logic lives in the Read-gate guard, not here.
- DROPPED 24h expiry: the kit expires the flag after 24h (``FLAG_EXPIRY_MS``).
  ADR-062 drives reset solely from the SessionStart lifecycle signal, so this
  port has no time-based expiry; reset is explicit and idempotent.
- DROPPED cclsp cold-start fields: the kit tracks ``cold_start_retries`` for a
  cclsp upstream bug. cclsp is not used here; the field is omitted.
