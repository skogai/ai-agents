"""Block git push when canonical agents/rules move without their install siblings.

Thin adapter over :mod:`push_guard_base`. Reuses the parity logic that lives
in ``build/scripts/validate_install_parity.py`` so the same rules apply in CI
(``scripts/validation/pre_pr.py``) and at push time (this guard). Activates on
any path that could anchor a parity group; the validator decides whether the
diff is actually drifting or whether the touched files form a clean group.

Hook Type: PreToolUse
Exit Codes (Claude Hook Semantics, exempt from ADR-035):
    0 = Allow (no parity drift detected, or the diff did not touch any
        tracked file)
    2 = Block (parity drift detected; the message lists missing siblings)

Fail-open path:
    The validator depends on the build script being importable. If the
    import or the call fails for an environmental reason (the build tree
    is absent on a consumer-repo checkout, the module raises an unexpected
    error), the guard fail-opens with an EVENT line so telemetry can
    flag the degraded state. Real parity violations always block; only
    infrastructure failures fail-open.
