"""Score a retrospective learning 0-100 for atomicity.

Pure scoring function plus a CLI. Phase 4 of the retrospective workflow scores
every extracted learning and rejects vague statements before they reach memory.

Canonical source: the deduction table and quality thresholds are lifted verbatim
from ``.claude/skills/retrospective/references/diagnosis-and-actions.md``
(section "Atomicity Scoring", lines 199-218). That reference in turn quotes the
agent body at ``.claude/agents/retrospective.md``. Quoted contract:

    | Factor | Adjustment |
    |--------|------------|
    | Compound statements ("and", "also") | -15% each |
    | Vague terms ("generally", "sometimes") | -20% each |
    | Length > 15 words | -5% per extra word |
    | Missing metrics/evidence | -25% |
    | No actionable guidance | -30% |

    ### Quality Thresholds

    | Score | Quality | Action |
    |-------|---------|--------|
    | 95-100% | Excellent | Add to skillbook |
    | 70-94% | Good | Add with refinement |
    | 40-69% | Needs Work | Refine before adding |
    | <40% | Rejected | Too vague |

Stricter/looser/different than canonical: the trigger word list is explicit.
The score starts at 100 and the deductions clamp to the 0-100 range. The
reference does not enumerate the exact trigger words for "compound" and "vague";
this module fixes a concrete word list
(``and``, ``also`` for compound; ``generally``, ``sometimes``, ``effective``,
``effectively``, ``good``, ``better``, ``well`` for vague) so the score is
deterministic and testable. The list includes ``effective`` because the canonical
worked example scores "The caching strategy was effective" as vague (lines
222-226 of the reference). The 70 percent persistence threshold used by the
SKILL.md Phase 5 contract is the boundary of the "Good" band above.

Exit codes (ADR-035):
  0: learning scored at or above the 70% persistence threshold
  1: learning scored below the 70% persistence threshold (refine or reject)
  2: usage or configuration error (missing argument, empty learning)
