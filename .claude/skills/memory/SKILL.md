# Memory System Skill

Unified memory operations across four tiers for AI agents.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check system health
python3 .claude/skills/memory/scripts/test_memory_health.py

# Search memory (Tier 1)
python3 .claude/skills/memory/scripts/search_memory.py "git hooks"

# Extract episode from session (Tier 2)
python3 .claude/skills/memory/scripts/extract_session_episode.py ".agents/sessions/2026-01-01-session-126.json"

# Update causal graph (Tier 3)
python3 .claude/skills/memory/scripts/update_causal_graph.py
```

## When to Use This Skill

| Scenario | Use Memory Router? | Alternative |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Script needs memory | Yes | - |
| Agent needs deep context | No | `exploring-knowledge-graph` skill |
| Human at CLI | No | `/memory-search` command |
| Cross-project semantic search | No | Forgetful MCP directly |

See the [exploring-knowledge-graph skill](../exploring-knowledge-graph/SKILL.md) for the deep-context decision tree and the five-source strategy (Issue #2103 folded the former context-retrieval agent into it).

## Memory-First as Chesterton's Fence

**Core Insight**: Memory-first architecture implements Chesterton's Fence principle for AI agents.

> "Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up" - G.K. Chesterton

**Translation for agents**: Do not change code/architecture/protocol until you search memory for why it exists.

### Why This Matters

**Without memory search** (removing fence without investigation):

- Agent encounters complex code, thinks "this is ugly, I'll refactor it"
- Removes validation logic that prevents edge case
- Production incident occurs
- Memory contains past incident that explains why validation existed

**With memory search** (Chesterton's Fence investigation):

- Agent encounters complex code
- Searches memory: `search_memory.py "validation logic edge case"`
- Finds past incident explaining why code exists
- Makes informed decision: preserve, modify, or replace with equivalent safety

### Investigation Protocol

When you encounter something you want to change:

| Change Type | Memory Search Required |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Remove ADR constraint | `search_memory.py "[constraint name]"` |
| Bypass protocol | `search_memory.py "[protocol name] why"` |
| Delete >100 lines | `search_memory.py "[component] purpose"` |
| Refactor complex code | `search_memory.py "[component] edge case"` |
| Change workflow | `search_memory.py "[workflow] rationale"` |

### What Memory Contains (Git Archaeology)

**Tier 1 (Semantic)**: Facts, patterns, constraints

- Why does PowerShell-only constraint exist? (ADR-005)
- Why do skills exist instead of raw CLI? (usage-mandatory)
- What incidents led to BLOCKING gates? (protocol-blocking-gates)

**Tier 2 (Episodic)**: Past session outcomes

- What happened when we tried approach X? (session replay)
- What edge cases did we encounter? (failure episodes)

**Tier 3 (Causal)**: Decision patterns

- What decisions led to success? (causal paths)
- What patterns should we repeat/avoid? (success/failure patterns)

### Memory-First Gate (BLOCKING)

**Before changing existing systems, you MUST**:

1. `python3 .claude/skills/memory/scripts/search_memory.py "[topic]"`
2. Review results for historical context
3. If insufficient, escalate to Tier 2/3
4. Document findings in decision rationale
5. Only then proceed with change

**Why BLOCKING**: <50% compliance with "check memory first" guidance. Making it BLOCKING achieves 100% compliance (same pattern as session protocol gates).

**Verification**: Session logs must show memory search BEFORE decisions, not after.

### Connection to Chesterton's Fence Analysis

See `.agents/analysis/chestertons-fence.md` for:

- 4-phase decision framework (Investigation → Understanding → Evaluation → Action)
- Application to ai-agents project (ADR-037 recursion guard, skills-first violations)
- Decision matrix for when to investigate
- Implementation checklist

**Key takeaway**: Memory IS your investigation tool. It contains the "why" that Chesterton's Fence requires you to discover.

## Context Engineering

This skill implements [progressive disclosure principles](../../../.agents/analysis/context-engineering.md) from Anthropic and claude-mem.ai research through three-layer architecture.

### Architecture

| Layer | Tool | Cost | When to Use |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| **Index** | `search_memory.py` | ~100-500 tokens | Always start here |
| **Details** | `mcp__serena__read_memory` | ~500-10K tokens | After index confirms relevance |
| **Deep Dive** | Follow cross-references | Variable | For complete understanding |

**Routing**: `search_memory.py "<q>"` keyword-ranks Serena memory names (Serena-first, augments with Forgetful when reachable, flags large memories by token estimate) and returns the relevant `*-index`; `read_memory` it, then follow its links to the atomic file. Raw fallback when scripting: guess `read_memory("<intuitive-name>")` (a miss is a cheap "not found", not a list), then the domain `*-index`, then `read_memory("memory-index")`. Prefer these name/index lookups over a bare `list_memories`. On add: update the `*-index` so the next agent finds it by name. Atomic files plus indexes are deliberate (no embeddings; filename is the activation vocabulary): do NOT consolidate atomic memories to cheapen listing, it breaks discovery and cross-links.

### Token Cost Visibility

```bash
# Count tokens before retrieval (informed ROI decision)
python3 .claude/skills/memory/scripts/count_memory_tokens.py .serena/memories/memory-index.md

# Output: memory-index.md: 2,450 tokens
```

**Caching**: SHA-256 hash-based cache in `.serena/.token-cache.json` provides 10-100x speedup on repeated queries.

See: [scripts/README-count-tokens.md](scripts/README-count-tokens.md)

### Size Validation

```bash
# Pre-commit hook: enforce atomicity thresholds
python3 .claude/skills/memory/scripts/test_memory_size.py .serena/memories --pattern "*.md"

# Exit 0 (pass) or 1 (fail) with decomposition recommendations
```

**Thresholds** (from `memory-size-001-decomposition-thresholds`):

- Max 10,000 chars (~2,500 tokens, atomic memory)
- Max 15 skills (independent concepts per file)
- Max 5 categories (domain focus)

See: [scripts/README-test-size.md](scripts/README-test-size.md)

### Principles

**Progressive Disclosure**: List names → Read details → Deep dive on cross-references. Prevents loading 9,500 tokens when only 1,200 are relevant (87% waste reduction).

**Just-in-Time Retrieval**: Serena-first with Forgetful augmentation. High precision through lexical search before expensive semantic operations.

**Size Enforcement**: Atomic memories prevent token waste. One retrievable concept per file.

## Decision Tree

```text
What do you need?
│
├─► Current facts, patterns, or rules?
│   └─► TIER 1: search_memory.py
│
├─► What happened in a specific session?
│   └─► TIER 2: Episode JSON in .agents/memory/episodes/
│
├─► Need to store new knowledge?
│   ├─ From completed session? → extract_session_episode.py
│   └─ Factual knowledge? → using-forgetful-memory skill
│
├─► Update decision patterns?
│   └─► TIER 3: update_causal_graph.py
│
└─► Not sure which tier?
    └─► Start with TIER 1 (search_memory.py), escalate if insufficient
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Do This Instead |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Skipping memory search | Always search before multi-step reasoning |
| Tier confusion | Follow decision tree explicitly |
| Forgetful dependency | Use `--lexical-only` fallback |
| Stale causal graph | Run `update_causal_graph.py` after extractions |
| Incomplete extraction | Only extract from COMPLETED sessions |

## Serena Write Conventions

These conventions govern writing a new Serena memory and registering it in its
domain index. They are the load-bearing rules absorbed from the former `memory`
agent (Issue #2102). For obsolete-marking, deduplication, and bidirectional
linking, use the `curating-memories` skill.

### Naming

- File name: `[domain]-[descriptive-name].md`, lowercase with hyphens (for
  example `pr-review-security.md`).
- Entity ID inside the file: `{domain}-{description}`, kebab-case, no prefix
  (for example `pr-enum-001`). File name and entity ID are separate; do not
  conflate them.

### Index-Table Insertion (hazard)

Domain index files (`skills-*-index.md`) contain ONLY a two-column table. When
you add a memory you MUST insert AFTER the last existing DATA row, never after
the header or the delimiter:

```text
| Keywords | File |    <-- header row
|----------|------|    <-- delimiter row (SKIP THIS)
| existing | file |    <-- data rows; insert after the LAST one
```

Inserting after the header or delimiter corrupts the table and breaks name-based
discovery for every reader. Do not add titles, statistics, or prose to an index
file.

### Relations (encoded in the memory body)

```markdown
## Relations

- **supersedes**: [previous-file-name]
- **depends_on**: [dependency-file-name]
- **related_to**: [related-file-name]
```

`supersedes` (new version replaces old), `depends_on` (requires another memory),
`related_to` (loose association).

### Source Tracking (required on every observation)

```text
[YYYY-MM-DD] [Source]: [Observation content]
```

Source forms: `[agent-name]`, `[doc:path]`, `[decision:ADR-NNN]`, `[user]`,
`[ext:source]`. Reasoning over actions: record WHY a choice was made, not just
WHAT was done.

### Conflict Resolution

When observations contradict, prefer the most recent, create a new memory with a
`supersedes` relation, and prefix with `[REVIEW]` when accuracy is uncertain.

---

## Verification

| Operation | Verification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Search completed | Result count > 0 OR logged "no results" |
| Episode extracted | JSON file in `.agents/memory/episodes/` |
| Graph updated | Stats show nodes/edges added |
| Health check | All tiers show "available: true" |

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/memory/scripts/test_memory_health.py --format table
```

---

## Process

### Phase 1: Query

Determine the memory tier and run the appropriate script.

### Phase 2: Validate

Verify results are non-empty and relevant to the query context.

### Phase 3: Report

Return structured results to the caller with source attribution.
