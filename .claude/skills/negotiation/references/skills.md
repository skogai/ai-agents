## Skill-Negotiation-001: Always Quantify the Value Gap

- **Statement**: Never describe an offer as "acceptable" or "fair" without first quantifying what value remains uncaptured. State the gap in dollar terms.
- **Context**: Any offer analysis (real estate, compensation, vendor, resource allocation).
- **Atomicity**: 95%
- **Evidence**: Anthropic Project Deal (Dec 2025). Internal Anthropic research; data not publicly available for audit. Reported pattern: Opus agents extracted more value per item than Haiku agents, and participants with weaker agents rated satisfaction identically despite objectively worse outcomes. Treat the qualitative finding (capability gap is invisible without quantification) as the load-bearing rule; specific dollar values are illustrative, not validated.
- **Impact**: Prevents accepting sub-optimal deals that feel satisfactory
- **Tags**: negotiation, value-gap, deal-intelligence

**Implementation**:

```text
INVISIBLE DISADVANTAGE CHECK:
  Offer net value: $[X]
  Achievable value: $[Y]
  Gap: $[Z] ([%])
  Reasoning: [specific market data, comps, or leverage]
```

## Skill-Negotiation-002: RADAR Protocol Sequence

- **Statement**: Every negotiation analysis follows Read, Analyze, Design, Assess, Review in sequence. Never skip steps.
- **Context**: Any offer evaluation requiring a counter-proposal
- **Atomicity**: 88%
- **Evidence**: Consistent application of structured analysis prevents anchoring to the other party's frame before establishing your own ZOPA.
- **Impact**: Prevents reactive countering from the wrong anchor
- **Tags**: negotiation, protocol, analysis

**Step sequence**:

1. Read: extract every term; identify anchors, hedging, urgency signals, omissions
2. Analyze: ZOPA, BATNA, information asymmetry, value gap
3. Design: PCP framing (Perception, Context, Permission) before counter
4. Assess: invisible disadvantage check; risk of countering vs. accepting
5. Review: DRAFT output with approval gate

## Skill-Negotiation-003: PCP Framing Before Anchoring

- **Statement**: Apply Perception, Context, Permission framing before presenting any counter number. Whoever defines the frame controls the negotiation.
- **Context**: Drafting counter-proposals
- **Atomicity**: 85%
- **Evidence**: Chase Hughes PCP model. Frame-setting is the highest-leverage move in any negotiation. The first number anchors the entire conversation.
- **Impact**: Reduces anchoring to the other party's number; increases acceptance rate of counter
- **Tags**: negotiation, influence, framing, PCP

**Pattern**:

- Perception: "This isn't [their framing], it's [your framing]."
- Context: "Market data, comps, or precedent shows [your anchor is normal]."
- Permission: "If you can do X, we can do Y." Give them a path to yes.

## Skill-Negotiation-004: Time Control

- **Statement**: Do not match urgency you did not create. Set your own cadence. Use silence after a counter.
- **Context**: Any negotiation with deadline pressure from the other party
- **Atomicity**: 82%
- **Evidence**: Navarro: "Whoever controls time, controls." Urgency pressure is the most common manipulation pattern. False deadlines dissolve when tested.
- **Impact**: Prevents concession under artificial pressure
- **Tags**: negotiation, time-control, pressure-tactics

**Test for genuine vs. tactical urgency**:

- Genuine: the deadline has a concrete external cause (closing date, board meeting, offer expiry)
- Tactical: the deadline serves only the other party's interest with no external anchor
- Response to tactical urgency: slow down, become methodical, request justification

## Skill-Negotiation-005: Bundle; Never Trade One Dimension

- **Statement**: When multiple terms are open, trade them as a package. Never concede one item in isolation.
- **Context**: Multi-term negotiations (real estate, comp, vendor contracts)
- **Atomicity**: 90%
- **Evidence**: Single-dimension concessions deplete leverage item by item. Bundling creates the perception of reciprocity while protecting total value.
- **Impact**: Preserves total deal value across all terms
- **Tags**: negotiation, bundling, concessions

**Pattern**:

- Identify all open dimensions (price, timeline, contingencies, concessions)
- When conceding on one: "We can do [X on dimension A] if you can do [Y on dimension B]"
- Never say "we can reduce the price" without extracting something in return

## Skill-Negotiation-006: Model Tier Routing for Negotiation Tasks

- **Statement**: Route negotiation analysis and counter-drafting to senior-tier models. Never route to junior.
- **Context**: Any agentic system where negotiation analysis is delegated
- **Atomicity**: 93%
- **Evidence**: Anthropic Project Deal (Dec 2025). Internal Anthropic research; data not publicly available for audit. Reported pattern: model capability gap produced a measurable per-item value difference (cited as ~$2.45 to $2.68 in source material), while prompting style (aggressive vs. friendly) showed no statistically significant effect. Treat "only model capability mattered" as the qualitative rule; specific dollar values are illustrative.
- **Impact**: Materially better outcome per item vs. weaker model (cited as ~13% in source material; treat as illustrative magnitude)
- **Tags**: negotiation, model-routing, agent-design, capability-tiers

**Routing rule**:

```yaml
task: negotiation-analysis
minimum_tier: senior
rationale: >
  Negotiation requires multi-step reasoning across ZOPA/BATNA,
  behavioral signal detection, and frame design. Junior models
  leave measurable value on the table without the loss being
  detectable to the human.
```

## Skill-Negotiation-007: Written Communication Signals

- **Statement**: Detect comfort/discomfort signals in written offers using adapted Navarro framework. Text has equivalent signals to nonverbal behavior.
- **Context**: Analyzing written offers, email threads, term sheets
- **Atomicity**: 78%
- **Evidence**: Navarro's comfort/discomfort binary applies to written communication via language patterns: hedging = flexibility, formality shift = discomfort, unprompted alternatives = weak BATNA.
- **Impact**: Surfaces hidden leverage without face-to-face interaction
- **Tags**: negotiation, behavioral-reading, written-signals

**Signal table**:

| Text Signal | Likely Meaning | Response |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Short clipped sentences | Power play or impatience | Slow down, add detail |
| Excessive qualifiers (just, maybe) | Insecurity, flexibility | Push harder here |
| Urgency framing (need answer by) | Pressure tactic OR genuine | Verify; do not match urgency |
| Matching your language/tone | Rapport building | Good sign, maintain |
| Shift to formal tone mid-thread | Discomfort, pulling back | Create safety |
| Unprompted alternatives listed | Weak BATNA | They need this deal more than stated |
| "Final offer" early | Anchoring attempt | Test with a counter |
| Long explanation for small ask | Guilt about ask | The ask is negotiable |

## Skill-Negotiation-008: Anchor First Only With Information Advantage

- **Statement**: Anchor first only when you have better data than the other party. Otherwise let them go first and use their anchor as information.
- **Context**: Any negotiation where the price or terms are not pre-set. Open offers, counter-offers, term sheet drafts.
- **Atomicity**: 86%
- **Evidence**: Anchoring research (Galinsky, Chen, Mussweiler) shows the first offer pulls the final price toward it. The exception: when you have information disadvantage, anchoring locks you to your wrong belief. Letting the other party anchor reveals their reservation point and leverage.
- **Impact**: Prevents leaving value on the table from low anchors. Prevents revealing weakness from high anchors without supporting data.
- **Tags**: negotiation, anchoring, information-asymmetry

**Decision rule**:

- You have better market data: anchor first, justify with data.
- They have better data: ask for their position first, then counter from your ZOPA, not their anchor.
- Information symmetric: anchor first if your ZOPA is wider than theirs, since you can move further without breaking.

## Skill-Negotiation-009: BATNA Discipline; Pre-Commit the Walkaway

- **Statement**: Define your walkaway price and conditions before negotiation starts. Write them down. Do not adjust mid-negotiation under emotional pressure.
- **Context**: Any negotiation where you have an actual alternative (other offers, status quo, no-deal option).
- **Atomicity**: 92%
- **Evidence**: Fisher and Ury (Getting to Yes). Negotiators who pre-commit to a written BATNA close at better prices and walk away cleanly when the deal is below their reservation point. Negotiators who set BATNA mid-conversation drift upward under sunk-cost pressure.
- **Impact**: Prevents accepting deals worse than your no-deal option. Prevents prolonged negotiation theater after the ZOPA has closed.
- **Tags**: negotiation, BATNA, walkaway, pre-commitment

**Pre-commitment artifact**:

```text
BATNA WORKSHEET (complete before first counter):
  Walkaway price: $[X]
  Walkaway conditions: [list non-negotiables]
  Best alternative: [specific named option, not "I'll find something"]
  Date BATNA reviewed: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

Adjustments mid-negotiation require a documented reason and a 24-hour delay.

## Skill-Negotiation-010: Close With Specificity; Reduce Buyer Remorse

- **Statement**: When agreement is reached, immediately summarize the specific terms in writing and confirm them with the other party. Do not let the deal float on verbal agreement.
- **Context**: End of any successful negotiation. Verbal yes, handshake, "we have a deal" moments.
- **Atomicity**: 88%
- **Evidence**: Voss (Never Split the Difference) on the "that's right" close. Cialdini's commitment-consistency research. Practitioner guidance across negotiation and transaction settings commonly treats prompt written confirmation as reducing ambiguity and lowering the chance that a verbal agreement later unravels; specific unwind-rate figures vary by source and are not asserted here without citation.
- **Impact**: Locks in agreed terms before either party second-guesses. Surfaces misalignment immediately when memory is fresh.
- **Tags**: negotiation, closing, commitment, written-confirmation

**Pattern**:

1. Recap terms in writing within 1 hour of verbal agreement.
2. Use their language, not yours, for ambiguous terms.
3. End with: "Confirming this matches your understanding."
4. Include date, parties, and any conditions or contingencies.
5. Send via the channel they prefer (email for formal, text for informal).
