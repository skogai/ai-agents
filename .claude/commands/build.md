Build: $ARGUMENTS

If $ARGUMENTS is empty, check for recent /plan output in the conversation. If none found, ask the user what to build.

## Complexity Assessment

Before implementation, Task(subagent_type="analyst"): Read `.claude/skills/analyze/references/engineering-complexity-tiers.md` and the task description. Classify as Tier 1-5. Return: tier, rationale, and recommended oversight level. Use this to calibrate implementation approach:
- Tier 1-2: Implement directly. Async code review sufficient.
- Tier 3: Validate approach before coding. Active mentorship pattern (check in at milestones).
- Tier 4-5: Proof-of-concept first. Get design sign-off before full implementation.

## Agent

Task(subagent_type="implementer"): You are a senior engineer. Discover the project's tech stack, coding patterns, and test conventions by reading the codebase. Build in thin vertical slices. Test-first when the project has tests. Commit atomically.

For each slice:

1. Read the task
2. Understand the existing code patterns (read related files, check test conventions)
3. Write a failing test if the project has a test framework
4. Write the minimum code to pass
5. Refactor toward quality (cohesion, encapsulation, simplicity)
6. Commit with a conventional message

## Quality Signals

After implementation, invoke Skill(skill="code-qualities-assessment") to score the result.

The agent should self-check:

- Is this hard to test? That indicates a design problem, not a test problem.
- Does every method read like a sentence? (Programming by Intention)
- Is coupling intentional or accidental?
- Would a stranger understand this code without asking questions?

## Guardrails

- Atomic commits. Each commit is one logical change, rollback-safe.
- No code without understanding the existing patterns first.
- Favor delegation over inheritance. A makes B, or A uses B. Never both.
- Three similar lines beat a premature abstraction.

## Optional Final Gate: Guard Maturity Report

Optionally invoke Skill(skill="guard-maturity") at the end of the build to print the Hook Maturity Model report for the push guards. This gate is **informational at landing**; promote it to mandatory after 30 days of real telemetry have accumulated in `.agents/telemetry/`. Until then, an empty report is expected and not a failure.

Rationale: the retrospective on PR #1887 (`.agents/retrospective/2026-05-05-pr-1887-iteration-paradox.md`) flagged that 95+ crystallized hooks earlier accumulated without measurement. The build flow surfaces the maturity report so contributors see the cost of new guards alongside the work they are landing. See `docs/guard-maturity-runbook.md` for how to read the output.
