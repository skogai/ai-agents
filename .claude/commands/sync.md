# Sync Command

Sync: $ARGUMENTS

The forward path (`/spec` -> `/plan` -> `/build`) turns intent into code. There is no clean reverse path. When you hand-edit code (refactor, hotfix, taste change), the spec drifts silently and the staleness surfaces only at `/review` time, late and often misattributed as "the spec was wrong" instead of "the spec needs updating". `/sync` closes that loop: it finds the drift while you still remember why you made the change.

## What this slice does

This command detects Spec->Code drift and reports it. It does NOT auto-rewrite specs. Detection runs; patch proposal is a follow-up (see Step 3).

## Triggers

| Phrase | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `/sync` | Scan all spec tiers for stale code references |
| `/sync .agents/specs/design` | Scan one spec tier |
| `detect spec drift` | Run the detector and report drift |

## Process

### Step 1: Detect drift

Run the drift detector against the specification tier:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync/detect_spec_drift.py --output-format human
```

The detector scans `.agents/specs/requirements`, `.agents/specs/design`, and `.agents/specs/tasks` for backticked references to code and artifact paths (`scripts/...`, `build/scripts/...`, `.claude/skills/...`, `.claude/commands/...`, `templates/...`, `tests/...`, `src/...`). Each reference is resolved against the working tree. A reference to a path absent on disk is drift: the spec points at code that moved or was deleted.

To scan one tier only, pass `--target`:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync/detect_spec_drift.py --target .agents/specs/design --output-format human
```

Exit codes (per ADR-035): `0` no drift, `1` drift found, `2` configuration error. Unsafe `--target` values (absolute paths, `..`, or symlink escapes) return exit `2`. Unsafe spec references are reported as drift instead of probing outside the repo.

### Step 2: Triage the findings

For each `DRIFT` line the detector reports (`spec_file:line -> path absent on disk`), decide which case applies:

- **Code moved**: the path was renamed. Update the spec reference to the current path.
- **Code deleted**: the capability was removed. Update the spec to reflect the removal, or restore the code if the removal was unintended.
- **Intentional forward reference**: the spec names a planned path that does not exist yet. Mark the line with a trailing `<!-- sync-drift-ignore -->` so the detector skips it.
- **Unsafe reference**: the spec uses `..`, an absolute path, or a symlink escape. Treat it as drift and update the spec to a repo-contained path.

Do not auto-apply edits. Confirm each case with the author of the change before touching the spec.

### Step 3: Propose spec patches (follow-up, not in this slice)

Patch proposal via the `spec-generator` agent is tracked as a follow-up. When wired, `/sync` will hand the drift findings to `Task(subagent_type="spec-generator")` to draft REQ/DESIGN/TASK edits and write a record under `.agents/specs/sync-log/` with the commit range it covered. Until then, apply the triage from Step 2 by hand and record the rationale in the PR description.

## Principles

- **Propose, do not auto-apply.** A human approves every spec edit. The detector flags; it never rewrites.
- **Detection is deliberate, not real-time.** Run `/sync` after a hand-edit. Real-time drift detection during `/build` is a `PostToolUse` hook concern, out of scope here.
- **The spec is a source of truth.** Drift erodes that. Catching it early keeps the spec defensible for "what does this code actually do" questions.

## Output

- The detector's `VERDICT` line (`PASS` or `DRIFT`) and per-finding `spec_file:line -> path` list.
- A triage decision per finding (moved / deleted / intentional).
- The spec edits applied or proposed, with rationale recorded in the PR description.

## Verification

- [ ] Detector exits `0` only when no drift exists.
- [ ] Detector exits `1` when stale references exist.
- [ ] Detector exits `2` for unsafe targets, unreadable specs, or missing custom targets.
- [ ] Copilot CLI-generated skill matches this command source.

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Treating unreadable specs as clean | Hides drift behind an I/O failure | Fail closed with exit `2` |
| Scanning absolute or parent targets | Walks outside the repository | Reject unsafe targets |
| Auto-rewriting specs | Changes source of truth without review | Report drift and require author triage |

## Extension Points

- Patch proposal via `spec-generator`.
- Additional reference roots in `scripts/sync/detect_spec_drift.py`.
- Sync log artifacts under `.agents/specs/sync-log/`.
