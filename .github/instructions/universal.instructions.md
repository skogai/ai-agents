# Universal Rules

These rules apply to every change in this repository.

## MUST

1. **Branch discipline**. MUST NOT push or commit directly to `main` or `master`. Create a feature branch first.
2. **Issue linkage**. Every PR MUST reference an issue with `Fixes #<n>` or `Refs #<n>` in the description.
3. **Conventional commits**. Commit messages MUST follow `<type>(<scope>): <desc>` and include a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer when authored with an AI agent.
4. **Atomic commits**. Each commit MUST touch five or fewer files (see `AGENTS.md` boundaries).
5. **No secrets**. MUST NOT commit credentials, tokens, or API keys. Secrets live in environment variables or the secrets manager.
6. **Pin Actions to SHA**. New GitHub Actions references MUST pin to a commit SHA, never a floating tag.
7. **Session log**. Long-running work MUST have a session log under `.agents/sessions/` per `.agents/SESSION-PROTOCOL.md`.

## SHOULD

1. **Retrieval-led reasoning**. SHOULD read `.agents/governance/PROJECT-CONSTRAINTS.md` and `.agents/architecture/ADR-*.md` before acting, not rely on pre-training.
2. **Skill-first**. SHOULD prefer an existing skill (`.claude/skills/<name>`) over inline `gh`, `git`, or shell scripting when a skill exists.
3. **Python for new scripts**. SHOULD use Python per ADR-042. MUST NOT create new bash scripts.
4. **Minimal diff**. SHOULD NOT introduce unrelated refactors in a change. Keep the blast radius small.

## MUST NOT

1. MUST NOT force-push shared branches.
2. MUST NOT skip hooks (`--no-verify`) or bypass signing.
3. MUST NOT edit `.agents/HANDOFF.md` (read-only per ADR-014).
4. MUST NOT put logic in YAML workflows (ADR-006).
5. MUST NOT use em-dashes (U+2014) or en-dashes (U+2013) in any authored text:
   markdown prose, code comments, agent prompts, commit messages, PR descriptions,
   rule files (`.claude/rules/`, `.github/instructions/`), retrospectives, ADRs,
   or session logs. Use commas, periods, colons, parentheses, hyphens, or
   restructure the sentence. Bot reviewers (Copilot, CodeRabbit) flag every
   occurrence; the cost is one or more threads per dash, every PR. The rule binds
   identically to the Copilot-side mirror at
   `.github/instructions/universal.instructions.md`; do not regress one tree
   while fixing the other. **Carve-out**: test fixtures under
   `tests/hooks/fixtures/` are exempt because they intentionally carry the
   prohibited bytes to exercise detection logic; the dash-guard hook and the
   `validate_dash_prohibition` validator both skip that prefix. Refs Issue #1923.
