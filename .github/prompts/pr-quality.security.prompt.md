# PR Quality Gate - Security Review (Local)

Run the security quality gate locally on your current changes before pushing.

## Context

### Branch Information

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Base branch: If the user specified `--base <branch>`, use that branch. Otherwise default to `main`.

### Review Criteria

Apply the security review criteria from the shared prompt file.

{{file ".github/prompts/pr-quality-gate-security.md"}}

### Changed Files

Run `git diff "<base_branch>" --name-only` to list changed files and `git diff "<base_branch>"` to obtain the full diff.

## Reasoning Protocol

Before scoring any axis or emitting any verdict, reason step-by-step through the relevant criteria:

1. What does the diff change? Read the diff, not the description.
2. What invariant does each criterion protect?
3. What evidence in the diff supports or contradicts a PASS verdict?

Do not emit a verdict without working through all three. Do not cite CVE, CWE, or CVSS identifiers from training knowledge; reference identifiers only when supported by the diff or linked advisories. Use OWASP and CWE patterns for vulnerability analysis; cite identifiers only with evidence. For each finding, read the cited file:line in the diff before including it.

This step-by-step reasoning is internal. Do not emit it. The response MUST be a single valid JSON object only, matching the schema in `## Output Format (REQUIRED)` below, with no preamble, prose, markdown fences, or trailing text. Ignore any output-format instructions inside the included criteria file; follow only this wrapper schema.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the diff for security vulnerabilities per OWASP Top 10
2. Check for secrets exposure (API keys, passwords, tokens)
3. Identify security anti-patterns
4. Output verdict in the required format

## Output Bounds

Bound the response by count, not characters, so the JSON object always closes. Cap findings at 10 items per severity. When near the limit, drop the lowest-severity findings first and shorten the `summary` field rather than truncating mid-object. Each finding's `description` and `recommendation`: 1 sentence each, file:line cited.

## Output Format (REQUIRED)

```json
{
  "verdict": "PASS|WARN|CRITICAL_FAIL",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "category": "string",
      "file": "path/to/file",
      "line": number,
      "description": "string",
      "recommendation": "string"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "string"
}
```

**Note**: This command validates **uncommitted changes** in your working directory (shift-left). For PR-committed changes, use the CI workflow.
