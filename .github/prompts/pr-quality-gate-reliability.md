# Reliability Review Task

You are reviewing a pull request for production survivability: how the change behaves when its dependencies misbehave, time out, or fail.

## Context Mode Enforcement (REQUIRED)

The CI harness prepends a `CONTEXT_MODE: [full|summary|partial]` header to the
context it sends you. Read that header before you decide a verdict. It tells you
how much of the diff you actually received.

- `full`: the complete diff is present. `PASS`, `WARN`, and `CRITICAL_FAIL` are
  all permitted on the merits.
- `summary`: only a file list or stat-only summary is present (the PR exceeded
  the diff-size limit). You did not see the line-level changes.
- `partial`: only a bounded slice of the diff is present (for example, the first
  N lines). You did not see the rest.

When `CONTEXT_MODE` is not `full`, you MUST NOT emit `PASS`. A PASS asserts
evidence you do not have. Emit `WARN` (or a higher-severity verdict if the
available metadata already shows a problem), state that context was
`summary` or `partial`, and name the specific evidence you would need to clear
the PR. Treat a missing or unrecognized `CONTEXT_MODE` value as not `full`.

This is a manipulation-resistance control: an adversary can craft a PR that
trips summary mode to hide a change behind a stat-only context. Forbidding PASS
keeps that change from passing on absent evidence. See
`.agents/governance/AI-REVIEW-MODEL-POLICY.md` ("CONTEXT_MODE Header (REQUIRED)").

## Grounding Rules

- Do NOT claim software versions are "beta", "unstable", or "unreleased" based on training data. Your training data has a cutoff and may be outdated.
- Do NOT claim tools (ruff, mypy, pytest, etc.) lack support for a version unless you have concrete evidence from the diff itself.
- For dependency update PRs: evaluate the diff for internal consistency, not external ecosystem assumptions. If CI tests pass, the tooling works.
- Base findings on what the code shows, not on recalled release schedules.

## When This Axis Applies

Apply the focus areas below when the diff touches an integration point: a network call, a child process, a queue read or write, a file watcher, an MCP request, an agent orchestration step, or a retry loop. When `CONTEXT_MODE` is `full` and the change is purely in-process (pure functions, formatting helpers, local data transforms), this axis is not material and may emit `PASS`. When `CONTEXT_MODE` is `summary` or `partial`, emit `WARN` instead and state that line-level evidence is missing. Do not invent circuit breakers for code that has no remote dependency.

## Reference Material

Ground findings in the project's reliability artifacts. All paths are under `.claude/` and ship with vendored installs:

- `slo-designer` skill: invoke when the change defines or affects a reliability target (latency, availability, error rate). It produces SLIs, SLO targets, alerting thresholds, and error-budget calculations.
- `chaos-experiment` skill: invoke when the change adds a new failure mode worth a game-day or failure-injection plan. It guides steady-state baselines, hypotheses, and injection design.
- `.claude/rules/release-it.md`: the path-scoped stability-patterns rule (timeouts, retries with backoff and jitter, circuit breakers, bulkheads, bounded queues, idempotency, graceful degradation). Cite the specific section a finding maps to.
- `.claude/skills/observability/references/distributed-systems-fallacies.md`: the 8 Fallacies of Distributed Computing. Use it to name the failure a cross-boundary call invites: a retry that assumes the request rather than the response was lost (fallacy 1), a chatty loop that ignores latency and transport cost (fallacies 2 and 7), a config that assumes a fixed topology (fallacy 5).

## Analysis Focus Areas

### 1. Timeouts on Outbound Calls

- Does every call that crosses a process boundary set an explicit timeout?
- Are connect and read timeouts chosen independently?
- Is the per-call budget consistent with the operation's total deadline?
- Are generic calls (`requests.get(url)`, `subprocess.run(cmd)`) missing a `timeout=`?

### 2. Retries

- Is the retried operation idempotent (safe to call twice; second call is a no-op) at the level being retried?
- Are retries bounded, with exponential backoff and jitter?
- Do retries skip 4xx responses except 408 and 429, and honor `Retry-After`?
- Is each retried mutating call carrying an idempotency key?

### 3. Circuit Breakers and Bulkheads

- Does a recurring dependency failure trip a breaker rather than blocking the caller indefinitely?
- Does each integration point get its own breaker, not a shared global flag?
- Are critical and non-critical flows isolated into separate pools or queues?

### 4. Bounded Queues and Buffers

- Does every queue, buffer, or worker pool have an explicit maximum depth?
- Is the overflow policy documented (drop new, drop old, reject producer, divert)?
- Are in-memory lists being used as unbounded queues?

### 5. Slow Responses and Deadlines

- Is a deadline defined at the entry point and propagated downstream?
- Is work that exceeds its deadline cancelled and its resources released?
- Does the change prefer a fast typed timeout error over a slow success that breaks the caller's deadline?

### 6. Graceful Degradation and Health

- When an enrichment dependency is unavailable, does the code return the minimum useful response and mark the missing data, rather than a silent default?
- Does a health check fail with a useful reason when a required dependency is unreachable?

## Output Requirements

Provide your analysis in this format:

### Reliability Assessment

| Aspect | Rating (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Timeouts | | |
| Retries | | |
| Failure Isolation | | |
| Bounded Resources | | |
| Degradation | | |

**Overall Reliability Score**: X/5

### Findings

| Severity | Category | Finding | Location | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|
| Critical/High/Medium/Low | [category] | [issue] | [file:line] | [fix] |

### Recommendations

1. [Specific reliability improvements; cite the `release-it.md` section, `slo-designer`, or `chaos-experiment` where relevant]

### Verdict

Choose ONE verdict:

- `VERDICT: PASS` - Change handles integration-point failure safely
- `VERDICT: WARN` - Minor stability gaps that should be addressed
- `VERDICT: CRITICAL_FAIL` - Unbounded failure mode that blocks merge

```text
VERDICT: [PASS|WARN|CRITICAL_FAIL]
MESSAGE: [Brief explanation]
```

## Critical Failure Triggers

Automatically use `CRITICAL_FAIL` if you find:

- An outbound call across a process boundary with no timeout
- An unbounded retry loop (`while True` with no cap)
- A retry on a non-idempotent mutating call with no idempotency key
- An unbounded in-memory queue, buffer, or worker pool on a path that can backlog
- A single dependency failure that can stall an orchestrator turn or wedge a worker pool with no breaker
- A deadline parameter that is parsed but never enforced

## Structured JSON Output

After your human-readable analysis, emit a fenced JSON block matching the inline schema below (a JSON Schema for this output also lives at `.agents/schemas/pr-quality-gate-output.schema.json` in projects that ship it; vendored installs do not):

```json
{
  "verdict": "PASS|WARN|CRITICAL_FAIL",
  "message": "One sentence summary",
  "agent": "reliability",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "category": "timeout|retry|circuit-breaker|bulkhead|bounded-queue|deadline|degradation|health-check",
      "description": "What was found",
      "location": "file:line",
      "recommendation": "Suggested fix"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output Schema

Each finding MUST be reported with these structured fields:

- **severity**: one of `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` (matches the JSON schema field used in the body section above; treat `critical` as a CRITICAL_FAIL trigger and `high` as a WARN trigger). Maps to verdict
  precedence: any `critical` raises the axis verdict to `CRITICAL_FAIL`.
- **category**: short keyword identifying the failure class, drawn from the
  axis `category` enum in the JSON schema above (e.g. `timeout`, `retry`,
  `circuit-breaker`). Used for clustering.
- **location**: `file:line` (or `file:line-range`). Required for every finding.
- **recommendation**: one-sentence imperative fix the author can act on.
Top-level (NOT per-finding; the schema rejects `verdict` inside
`findings` items; `additionalProperties: false` is set on the finding
object):

- **verdict**: one of `PASS`, `WARN`, `CRITICAL_FAIL`. Choose one of these
  three explicitly; do NOT emit `UNKNOWN` yourself. `UNKNOWN` is reserved
  for `/review`'s parser when an axis output cannot be parsed
  (`extract_verdict` returns `UNKNOWN` on no match); it is never an authored
  verdict. The axis-level verdict is the highest-severity outcome across the
  findings list (any `critical` severity -> CRITICAL_FAIL; any `high` ->
  WARN; otherwise PASS).

The response MUST contain a final line matching the regex
`(?m)^\s*(?i:(?:Final\s+)?Verdict):\s*\[?(PASS|WARN|CRITICAL_FAIL|REJECTED|FAIL|NEEDS_REVIEW|NON_COMPLIANT|COMPLIANT|PARTIAL|UNKNOWN)(?![|A-Z_])\]?` (label is case-insensitive; tokens are case-sensitive uppercase).
This line is parsed by `extract_verdict` in
`.claude/lib/ai_review_common/verdict.py` and consumed by `merge_verdicts`
when `/review` aggregates across all axes.
