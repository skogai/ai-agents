## Summary

<!--
What changed and *why*. The "why" is the part reviewers cannot get from the diff.
Keep this section short. Prefer many small PRs over one large one; isolate
rebases and pure refactors into their own commits or PRs.
-->

### What

<!-- 1-3 sentences on the change itself -->

### Why

<!-- The motivation: bug, requirement, ADR, incident, or constraint that drove this -->

## Specification References

<!-- Enable AI spec-to-implementation traceability -->
<!-- The ai-spec-validation workflow checks for these references -->

| Type | Reference | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Issue** | Closes #<!-- issue number --> | <!-- Issue title --> |
| **Spec** | `.agents/planning/...` | <!-- Planning document --> |
| **Spec** | `.agents/specs/...` | <!-- Spec document (if applicable) --> |

### Spec Requirement Guidelines

| PR Type | Spec Required? | Guidance |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Feature** (`feat:`, `feat(scope):`) | Required | Link issue, REQ-*, or spec file in `.agents/planning/` |
| **Bug fix** (`fix:`, `fix(scope):`) | Optional | Link issue if exists; explain root cause if complex |
| **Refactor** (`refactor:`, `refactor(scope):`) | Optional | Explain rationale and scope in PR description |
| **Documentation** (`docs:`) | Not required | N/A |
| **Infrastructure** (`ci:`, `build:`, `chore:`) | Optional | Link ADR or design doc if architecture impacted |

<!--
Supported reference formats:
- Issues: "Closes #123", "Fixes #456", "Implements #789"
- Requirements: "REQ-001", "DESIGN-002", "TASK-003"
- Spec files: ".agents/specs/requirements/...", ".agents/planning/..."

For feature PRs: Create spec in .agents/planning/ before submitting if none exists.
For other PRs: Add references when traceability adds value.

substance, not on catching what tooling already catches.

## Notes for Reviewers

<details>
<summary>Review norms (expand)</summary>

Canonical source: [.agents/governance/code-review-norms.md](https://github.com/rjmurillo/ai-agents/blob/main/.agents/governance/code-review-norms.md). The summary below is for convenience; the canonical file is authoritative.

- **Assume competence and goodwill.** A "bad" PR usually means one party has information the other does not.
- **Explain *why*, not just *what*.** "This is wrong because..." beats "this is wrong."
- **Approve once the change improves overall code health.** Perfect is not the bar.
- **Target reply within ~1 business day.** If you cannot, leave a comment saying when you can.
- **Prefer "Approve with suggestions"** for minor issues, especially across timezones.
- **Authors: address every comment** by adopting, deferring (with a tracking issue), or pushing back with reasoning. Silence is not resolution.

**Comment severity prefixes** (so authors can triage):

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Nit:` | Minor / style; do not block on it |
| `Optional:` | Worth considering; author may defer |
| `FYI:` | Future thought; no action needed |
| *(no prefix)* | Must address before merge |
