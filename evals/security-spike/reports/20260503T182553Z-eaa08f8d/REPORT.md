## Confidence Interval

**Note**: this run halted at AC-10's flakiness gate. The CI below is reported for diagnostic context; statistical significance does not unblock the verdict, which is fixed at `halt-due-to-flakiness` until the variance source is investigated and the methodology is re-run.

Paired bootstrap, n=10000 resamples at fixture level. The 95% CI on the signed recall delta is **[+11.11pp, +64.29pp]**. The interval **excludes** zero, so the observed delta is statistically distinguishable from no effect.

## Recommendation

**Verdict**: `halt-due-to-flakiness`

## Cost and Resource Summary

- Total tokens in: 253,266
- Total tokens out: 8,574
- Estimated cost: $0.8884 USD (rate as of 2026-05-03)
- Wall-clock time: 620.0s

_Token counts are estimated from a text-length heuristic (~4 chars per token); cost is not authoritative. Replace with measured `usage` from the API response in a follow-up._

## Flakiness

At least one fixture exhibited non-zero pass-rate variance across runs on the same `(prompt_sha, fixture_set_sha)`.

Excluded from delta: _(none excluded)_
