"""Classify push guards into Hook Maturity Model tiers.

Consumes the JSON output of ``aggregate_guard_intercepts.py`` and assigns
each guard one of six tiers based on age, intercept volume, and a fitness
signal derived from block rate.

Tiers (evaluated in order; first match wins):

- ``Harmful``: any age, ≥1 intercept, fitness < ``-0.02``. Remove
  immediately. A guard that mostly fails open or that catches things it
  should not is doing harm; it normalizes bypass.
- ``Proficient``: ≥60 days since first event, ≥10 intercepts, fitness
  ≥ ``+0.02``. Promote and keep.
- ``Mature``: ≥30 days since first event, ≥5 intercepts, fitness ≥ 0.
  Keep and watch.
- ``Inert``: ≥30 days since first event, 0 intercepts. Prune candidate.
  Either no real diff has tripped it, or the validator is too narrow to
  fire.
- ``Growing``: 14-30 days since first event, ≥1 intercept. Adolescent;
  too young for promotion, too productive to drop.
- ``Budding``: <14 days since first event. New, anything goes.

A guard with no events at all but listed by ``--guard`` falls into
``Budding`` if its days-since-first-event is null (never seen) and
``--treat-unseen-as-inert`` is false; pass that flag to mark guards
that have been registered for some time as Inert when their first event
is null. The default is conservative: a guard that has never fired
might just be brand new.

Fitness rationale: in this codebase a guard EITHER blocks (catches a
real or precautionary issue) OR fails open (the framework or the
validator could not run; see ``push_guard_base.py``'s contract).
``block_rate`` therefore measures "how often did the guard do its job
when it had the chance". Block rate alone is not a fitness *delta*: a
guard that always blocks may be too noisy. The classifier maps block
rate to a centered fitness value:

    fitness = block_rate - 0.5

So a guard that blocks half the time has fitness 0 (neutral); blocking
much more often is positive (doing real work); blocking far less than
half is negative (mostly noise / fail-opens). Thresholds use ``±0.02``
to capture meaningful positive or negative signal without rounding
small samples to zero.

Future work: the wiki's Hook Maturity Model concept references a
fitness score derived from "true positive vs noisy positive" signals
that this codebase does not capture today. When per-event ground-truth
labels exist, swap the fitness formula in ``compute_fitness`` without
changing the threshold table.

Exit codes (per AGENTS.md):
    0 = ok
    1 = logic error (input not parseable)
    2 = config error (bad --source path)
