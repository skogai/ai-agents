# Claude Model Behavioral Patches

These nudges are tuned for the Claude model family (Anthropic models). They apply whenever Claude is the runtime model, regardless of harness (Claude Code CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI invoking Anthropic, the Anthropic API, an IDE extension wrapping Claude). The patches encode behaviors that the model tends to drift from without explicit prompting.

**Loading vs. obeying.** In the canonical source under `.claude/rules/` this file's frontmatter sets `priority: critical`, meaning the rule loader MUST include the file in every session's context. That key is intentionally stripped from the generated Copilot instruction mirrors (`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, `src/copilot-cli/instructions/*.instructions.md`) because those trees use a different frontmatter contract (`applyTo` only). The CONTENT priority of each patch against other rules is set by the Precedence section below. Critical-to-load is not the same as critical-to-obey; the next section sets the obey order.

## Precedence

These patches are subordinate to:

- Skill workflows (any `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` instruction in this repo, or `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or any installed plugins).
- STOP points and confirmation gates inside skills.
- `AskUserQuestion` (or harness equivalent) blocking on user decision.
- Plan-mode safety in Claude Code.
- The `/ship` review gate and equivalent push-time checks.

When a patch below conflicts with one of those, the skill or gate wins. Treat the patches as preferences in those conflicts. Outside of those conflicts the patches still apply: they encode default behavior that the model otherwise drifts from.

## Todo-list Discipline

When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

Reason: a batched complete-everything-at-the-end pattern hides progress from the user and from any orchestrator watching the run. If the model crashes or the session ends mid-run, the todo list still reflects reality up to the last completed step. Batched updates make every recovery start from zero.

Applies to: the harness's todo or task tool (Claude Code's `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate`, Copilot CLI's task list, any skill that exposes a step tracker).

**Parallel tasks.** Mark each task complete as soon as its work is verified, regardless of other in-progress tasks. Do not wait for siblings to finish.

## Think Before Heavy Actions

For complex operations, state your approach in 2 to 3 sentences before executing. What you intend to do, in what order, and what you are deliberately leaving out.

What counts as a "heavy action":

- A refactor that touches 4 or more files.
- A migration (schema, format, API version, dependency major bump).
- A new feature that touches more than one file OR more than one logical component.
- Anything that changes a public contract (signature, exported type, wire format, configuration shape).
- Anything irreversible without significant cleanup (delete, rewrite, force-push, schema drop).

The cost of a two-sentence preamble is roughly zero. The cost of a 30-minute rollback is everything. The user course-corrects cheaply when the plan is visible up front; not when the diff is already on disk.

**When a heavy action fails midway.** Mark the in-flight task as failed with a one-line reason. If partial changes are reversible (uncommitted edits, unpushed commits), revert them. If not (pushed commits, mutated external state), state what was changed and what was not. Ask the user before retrying; do not retry blindly.

## Dedicated Tools Over Bash

Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over their shell equivalents (`cat`, `sed`, `find`, `grep`).

Why:

- **Cheaper.** The dedicated tools have lower context impact. Bash pipes paste full outputs into the conversation; the dedicated tools surface only what they actually need.
- **Clearer.** The tool name announces the intent. A reviewer scanning the transcript can read "Edit auth.ts" faster than parsing `sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' auth.ts`.
- **Safer.** No shell quoting traps. No command-injection surface. No accidental glob expansion against paths the model did not intend.

Reserve Bash for operations the dedicated tools cannot perform: `git`, package managers (`npm`, `pip`, `uv`, `cargo`), build runners (`make`, `python build/scripts/build_all.py`), anything that needs a real shell environment or a multi-stage pipe.

**When a dedicated tool is unavailable in the current harness.** Fall back to the closest Bash equivalent and state the fallback in your response so the user knows the tool boundary was crossed.

Specific anti-patterns to reject:

- `cat <file>` to read for analysis. Use Read.
- `grep <pattern>` for symbol or text search. Use Grep.
- `find . -name <pattern>` for file location. Use Glob.
- `sed -i` to mutate a file. Use Edit.
- Heredocs to create a new file. Use Write.

Allowed Bash patterns:

- `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`.
- `gh <subcommand>` for GitHub API operations the harness does not expose.
- `python3 build/scripts/<name>.py` and other repo-specific runners.
- `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv` for directory operations.
- One-shot diagnostics (`uname`, `which`, `ls -la <specific path>`) when a dedicated tool does not cover it.

## Quick Self-Check

Run this check only at decision points: starting a heavy action, switching tasks, or about to call Bash. Not every turn; the per-turn overhead would compete with throughput.

- If this is one step in a multi-step plan, is the previous step's todo already marked complete?
- If this action is heavy (per the list above), did I state the approach?
- If I am about to call Bash, is there a dedicated tool that would do this better?

If any answer is "no" or "not sure," adjust before proceeding.
