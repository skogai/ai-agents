# /pr-autofix

Autonomous PR monitor and fixer. Implements the protocol from
`docs/autonomous-pr-monitor.md`.

## Triggers

| Trigger phrase | Operation |
|----------------|-----------|
| `pr-autofix` | Triage all open PRs by tier and act |
| `autofix this pr` | Single-PR mode on the current branch's open PR |
| `monitor open prs` | Periodic triage without merging |
| `auto-merge ready prs` | Tier 1 only: enable auto-merge on land-ready PRs |
| `address pr feedback` | Tier 3/4 only: walk thread lifecycle |

## Process

Three phases. Tier-based dispatch decides which actions apply per PR.

### Phase 1: Triage

Run `test_pr_merge_ready.py` for every open PR. Classify each into a tier (T1-T5) using the table below. Sort the queue by tier ascending.

### Phase 2: Act per tier

Walk the queue. For each PR, apply the tier's action set. T1 first (land-ready), then T2 (CI fix), then T3/T4 (threads), then T5 (bot).

### Phase 3: Verify and gate

After all queued actions, re-check the 4-condition Ready-to-Merge gate. Enable auto-merge only when all four conditions hold.

## Workflow

1. Triage all open PRs into tiers T1-T5 using `test_pr_merge_ready.py`.
2. Process T1 (land-ready) first, then T2 (CI fix), T3/T4 (threads), T5 (bot).
3. For each PR: address review threads, fix CI failures using known patterns, enable auto-merge.

## Ready-to-Merge Definition (4 conditions, ALL required)

1. Branch up to date with `main` (`mergeStateStatus` not `BEHIND`).
2. All required checks pass.
3. All conversations addressed: READ, TRIAGED, SOLVED (if Blocking), REPLIED with course of action, RESOLVED.
4. `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN` (or `UNSTABLE` with documented non-required failures).

`CanMerge=True` from `test_pr_merge_ready.py` alone is insufficient. Cross-check all four conditions.

## Tier Definitions

| Tier | Criteria | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| T1 | Branch up to date, no CI failures, no threads, `CLEAN` | Enable auto-merge |
| T2 | CI failures only, branch up to date | Fix CI, verify required checks pass |
| T3 | Threads only (CI passing) | Walk full thread lifecycle, then merge |
| T4 | Both CI failures + threads | Fix CI first, then lifecycle threads |
| T5 | Bot PR with validation failures | Handle individually |

If `BEHIND`, update branch against main BEFORE other actions (see doc Branch Update section).

## Fix Patterns

- **PR description mismatch**: Remove file references not in the diff (use GitHub API to PATCH body).
- **Branch behind main**: Worktree + `git merge origin/main --no-edit` + push (no force needed).
- **Stale CI check**: Push fresh commit to re-trigger; avoid `--no-verify` if possible.
- **Bot review threads**: Read, triage per Thread Severity, reply with disposition, resolve via `add_pr_review_thread_reply.py --resolve`.
- **Session validation failure**: Use session-log-fixer skill.

## Force-Push Safety

Before any push: verify `git rev-parse "refs/heads/$BRANCH"` matches the PR's expected `head.sha` from `get_pr_context.py`. (Prefer `rev-parse` over plain-file reads of `.git/refs/heads/<branch>`: rev-parse resolves loose refs AND refs that have been compacted into `.git/packed-refs`; a plain-file read returns "missing ref" when the branch lives only in `packed-refs`.) If the local ref points to a bootstrap/sandbox commit, STOP. Investigate corruption before pushing. Force-push only with explicit user authorization, using SHA-pinned source with quoted refspec:

```bash
SHA="<known-good-sha>"
BRANCH="<branch-name>"
git push origin "${SHA}:refs/heads/${BRANCH}" --force-with-lease --no-verify
```

Quote every variable expansion. The shell does not treat `:` specially in a refspec; the real reason to quote is that branch names can contain characters the shell DOES treat specially (`*`, `?`, `[`, whitespace), and unquoted `$BRANCH` will word-split or glob on those.

## Scripts

```bash
# Check merge readiness
python3 .claude/skills/github/scripts/pr/test_pr_merge_ready.py --pull-request {pr}

# Get CI check logs
python3 .claude/skills/github/scripts/pr/get_pr_checks.py --pull-request {pr} | \
  python3 .claude/skills/github/scripts/pr/get_pr_check_logs.py --pull-request {pr} --checks-input -

# Enable auto-merge
python3 .claude/skills/github/scripts/pr/set_pr_auto_merge.py --pull-request {pr} --enable --merge-method SQUASH
```

## Completion Gate

Run after all threads resolved and CI passes:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/github/scripts/pr/run_completion_gate.py \
  --config .claude/commands/pr-review-config.yaml \
  --pull-request {pr} --json
```

## Verification

Per PR processed:

- [ ] Tier classification recorded (T1-T5).
- [ ] All required CI checks pass (T2/T4 only).
- [ ] Every review thread is READ, TRIAGED, SOLVED (if Blocking), REPLIED with course of action, and RESOLVED (T3/T4 only).
- [ ] `mergeStateStatus` is `CLEAN` (or `UNSTABLE` with documented non-required failures).
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main` (`mergeStateStatus` not `BEHIND`).
- [ ] Force-push safety check ran before any push: `git rev-parse "refs/heads/$BRANCH"` matched the PR's expected `head.sha`.
- [ ] Auto-merge enabled only when all four Ready-to-Merge conditions hold (CanMerge=True is insufficient alone).
