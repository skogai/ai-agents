# Monolith Section Classification: .agents/*.md Extraction

> **Issue**: #1769 (Phase 1 audit)
> **Date**: 2026-06-01
> **Scope**: Every top-level `##` section in the three always-loaded monoliths
> **Method**: Static section inventory (fence-aware) + steering overlap check

## Summary

Phase 1 of #1769 is an audit only. It maps every top-level `##` section in the
three monolith instruction files to one of three destinations and does NOT move
any content. Content moves happen in later phases.

Destinations:

- **KEEP-IN-STEERING**: content already lives in an `.agents/steering/*.md` file.
  Per decision D6, the steering file stays authoritative and the section is not
  re-extracted into a rule.
- **ALWAYS-LOAD-RULE**: universal safety invariant. Lands in the one always-load
  rule (`agent-boundaries.md`, `applyTo: "**"`, `priority: critical`).
- **PATH-SCOPED-RULE**: loads only when a matching path is touched. Lands in one
  of the six path-scoped rule files with an `applyTo:` glob.

Frontmatter follows the repo convention (`applyTo:` + `priority:`), NOT the
issue's stale `paths:`/`alwaysApply:` keys. See the binding decision comment on
#1769 (2026-05-31): when the issue was filed, `.claude/rules/` held 1 file and
no generator. Main now has ~29 rule files and `build/scripts/generate_rules.py`,
which generates BOTH `.github/instructions/` and `src/copilot-cli/instructions/`
from `.claude/rules/`. Phase 2 authors rules and runs the generator; it does not
hand-author the Copilot mirror.

Section counts measured fence-aware (headings inside fenced code blocks, which
are template/example content, are excluded):

| Monolith | Top-level `##` sections | Lines |
|----------|-------------------------|-------|
| `AGENT-SYSTEM.md` | 13 | 1989 |
| `AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` | 18 | 824 |
| `SESSION-PROTOCOL.md` | 16 | 1191 |
| **Total** | **47** | **4004** |

## Target Rule Files (Phase 2)

| Rule file | `applyTo:` | `priority:` |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| `agent-boundaries.md` | `**` | `critical` |
| `session-protocol.md` | `.agents/sessions/**` | `high` |
| `agent-catalog.md` | `templates/agents/**,src/claude/**,.claude/agents/**` | `high` |
| `memory-handoff.md` | `.agents/**,.serena/**` | `normal` |
| `workflow-routing.md` | `templates/**,.agents/planning/**` | `normal` |
| `phase-execution.md` | `.agents/planning/**,.agents/sessions/**` | `normal` |
| `governance-agents.md` | `.agents/governance/**` | `high` |

Phase 2 must treat internal-only globs as Claude rule scopes, not portable mirror
scopes. `build/scripts/generate_rules.py` strips `.agents/`, `.claude/`, and
`.serena/` when it emits Copilot instruction mirrors, and all-internal scopes can
collapse to `applyTo: "**"` in generated outputs.

`governance-agents.md` avoids colliding with the existing `.claude/rules/governance.md`,
which already scopes `.agents/governance/**` for governance-file edit rules. The
new rule carries the agent quality-gate and conflict-resolution directives.

## Steering Overlap Reference (D6)

A section maps to KEEP-IN-STEERING only when its content already has a steering
owner. The steering files and their scopes:

| Steering file | `applyTo:` |
|---------------|------------|
| `agent-prompts.md` | `src/claude/**/*.md,.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| `claude-skills.md` | `.claude/skills/**` |
| `documentation.md` | `**/*.md` (excl. `src/claude/**`, steering) |
| `powershell-patterns.md` | `**/*.ps1,**/*.psm1` |
| `security-practices.md` | `**/Auth/**,*.env*,**/*.secrets.*,.github/workflows/**,.githooks/**` |
| `testing-approach.md` | `**/*.Tests.ps1` |

## Tallies

| Classification | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| ALWAYS-LOAD-RULE | 4 |
| PATH-SCOPED-RULE | 33 |
| KEEP-IN-STEERING | 10 |
| **Total sections** | **47** |

ALWAYS-LOAD sections (the only content entering `agent-boundaries.md`):

- AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS `Quick Start Checklist`
- AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS `Critical Reminders`
- AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS `Emergency Recovery`
- SESSION-PROTOCOL `RFC 2119 Key Words`

## Notes and Caveats for Phase 2

- This is a static section map. Phase 2 MUST re-read each section before moving
  it, because line counts shift as content compresses.
- KEEP-IN-STEERING does not mean "delete." The slimmed monolith keeps a one-line
  pointer to the steering owner so existing `read()` references stay valid (D1).
- Two KEEP-IN-STEERING calls route to existing `.claude/rules/` files, not
  steering: `Commit Message Format` is already in `universal.md`, and markdown
  standards are owned by `documentation.md` steering. Phase 2 MUST NOT duplicate
  either into a new rule.
- `agent-boundaries.md` must stay under 100 lines. The four always-load sections
  above total well over that in raw form; Phase 2 compresses them to invariant
  bullets, dropping prose and examples.
- No content was moved in this PR. This document is the only file added.
