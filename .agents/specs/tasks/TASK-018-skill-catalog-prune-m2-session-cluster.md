# TASK-018: Skill Catalog Prune M2 Session Cluster

## Design Context

Implements DESIGN-018 for Issue #1946. The session-cluster M2 work keeps QA eligibility behavior in `session` and deletes the inactive migration skill after confirming active session logs are JSON at creation.

## Objective

Remove the `session-migration` skill and its tests, clean live references, regenerate mirrors, and verify no changed reference surface points callers at deleted skills.

## In Scope

- Delete `.claude/skills/session-migration/`.
- Delete `src/copilot-cli/skills/session-migration/`.
- Delete root `scripts/convert_session_to_json.py` and its tests.
- Update session-init, memory extraction, skill reference, evaluator, and allowlist documentation.
- Validate targeted tests, orphan references, generated mirrors, and plugin manifests.

## Out of Scope

- Rewriting `.github/workflows/ai-session-protocol.yml`.
- Migrating historical markdown archives.
- Creating a replacement migration skill or shim.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] TASK-018-AC1: `.claude/skills/session-migration/` does not exist.
- [x] TASK-018-AC2: `src/copilot-cli/skills/session-migration/` does not exist.
- [x] TASK-018-AC3: `session-init` guidance creates JSON logs directly and does not instruct callers to run migration.
- [x] TASK-018-AC4: `docs/skill-reference.md` identifies `session` as the QA eligibility owner.
- [x] TASK-018-AC5: `tests/evals/skills/triage-prompts.json` has negative-routing fixtures for old session skill names.
- [x] TASK-018-AC6: `uv run python -m pytest tests/skills/test_session_scripts.py tests/skills/session/ tests/skills/memory/test_extract_session_episode.py -q` passes.
- [x] TASK-018-AC7: scoped `orphan-ref-validator` passes on changed reference surfaces.
- [x] TASK-018-AC8: `python3 build/scripts/build_all.py --check` passes.
- [x] TASK-018-AC9: plugin manifest validation and parity checks pass.
