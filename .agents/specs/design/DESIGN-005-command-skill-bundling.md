# DESIGN-005: Bundle Dedicated Skills into Lifecycle Commands

## Requirements Addressed

- REQ-005 AC-1 through AC-14: all fourteen acceptance criteria are satisfied by edits to seven command files plus two supporting artifacts (test file and pre_pr.py check).

## Design Overview

Seven markdown command files are edited in place to add `Skill(skill="<name>")` invocations at defined phases. No runtime code is generated. A flat BundleRegistry table (below) is the authoritative record of what fires where. Two supporting artifacts enforce the registry at test time and at PR gate time.

## Source

This design is derived from `.agents/analysis/command-skill-bundling-2026-05-03.md` (2026-05-03), which identified all gaps and proposed the fix for each command.

---

## BundleRegistry

The registry is the canonical mapping. Every `Skill(skill="...")` call added by this spec appears here. AC-14 (`pre_pr.py`) and the test file both validate against this table.

| Command file | Skill name | Gate type | Phase | Presence marker | AC# |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `spec.md` | `session-init` | always | preflight | (none; skill owns missing-marker handling) | AC-1 |
| `ship.md` | `session-end` | always | postflight | (none; skill owns missing-marker handling) | AC-2 |
| `ship.md` | `reflect` | always | postflight | (none) | AC-2 |
| `plan.md` | `pre-mortem` | always | step-6 | (none) | AC-3 |
| `plan.md` | `decision-critic` | always | step-7 | (none) | AC-4 |
| `build.md` | `context-gather` | always | preflight | (none) | AC-5 |
| `build.md` | `steering-matcher` | always | preflight | (none) | AC-5 |
| `build.md` | `chestertons-fence` | presence | preflight | diff contains file with last commit > 6 months old | AC-5 |
| `test.md` | `threat-modeling` | conditional | gate-3 | complexity tier >= 3 | AC-6 |
| `test.md` | `slo-designer` | always | gate-6 | (none) | AC-7 |
| `test.md` | `observability` | always | gate-6 | (none) | AC-7 |
| `review.md` | `doc-accuracy` | always | axis-6 | (none) | AC-8 |
| `review.md` | `chestertons-fence` | presence | axis-1 | diff touches file with last commit > 6 months old | AC-8 |
| `pr-review.md` | `merge-resolver` | presence | step-2 | `gh pr view --json mergeable -q '.mergeable'` returns `CONFLICTING` or `UNKNOWN` | AC-9 |
| `research.md` | `context-gather` | always | preflight | (none) | AC-10 |

**Gate types**:
- `always`: unconditional; fires every invocation.
- `presence`: fires only when a marker file or condition is met; emits `skipped:no-marker` otherwise.
- `conditional`: fires when a computed condition holds (e.g., complexity tier from a prior step).

---

## Presence-Marker Table

Only **runtime conditionals** appear here. External-infrastructure presence checks (e.g., `.agents/SESSION-PROTOCOL.md` for session-init/session-end) are owned by the skill itself, not by the command, per Q2 resolution.

| Skill | Command | Runtime gate | Check method |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chestertons-fence` | `build.md` | diff contains file with last commit > 6 months old | `Bash(git log --format=%at -1 -- "<file>")`, quote path to prevent CWE-78 |
| `chestertons-fence` | `review.md` | diff touches file with last commit > 6 months old | same as above |
| `merge-resolver` | `pr-review.md` | `gh pr view --json mergeable -q '.mergeable'` returns `CONFLICTING` or `UNKNOWN` | `gh pr view $PR --json mergeable -q '.mergeable'` |
| `threat-modeling` | `test.md` | complexity tier from Step 0 is 3 or higher | (read tier from prior step output) |

Security note: presence checks MUST use `Read` or `Bash(test -f <literal-path>)`. User-supplied input MUST NOT be interpolated into any shell command (CWE-78 prevention).

---

## BUNDLE Marker Format

Every bundled invocation has a parseable marker in the command markdown adjacent to the `Skill(...)` call. This is a **static contract** (the marker exists in the file text for test verification), not runtime stdout.

Format:

```
BUNDLE: <command> -> <skill> (<status>)
```

Where:
- `<command>` is the slash-command name (e.g., `spec`, `ship`, `build`).
- `<skill>` is the exact skill name passed to `Skill(skill="...")`.
- `<status>` is one of:
  - `invoked`: the skill was called.
  - `skipped:no-marker`: the presence marker was absent.
  - `failed:<reason>`: the skill returned an error; `<reason>` is a short string, no PII, no secrets.

Example inline pattern:

```markdown
Emit `BUNDLE: spec -> session-init (invoked)`, then invoke `Skill(skill="session-init")`.
```

The test file parses command files for both the `Skill(skill="...")` call and the adjacent `BUNDLE:` text. This is a markdown-text-search, not a runtime output capture.

---

## Per-Command Edit Specifications

### spec.md

**Phase**: preflight (before Step 1 "Clarify the problem")

**Before** (current Step 1 heading):
```markdown
## Process

1. Clarify the problem (what, who, why, constraints)
```

**After**:
```markdown
## Process

0. **Session init**: Emit `BUNDLE: spec -> session-init (invoked)`, then invoke `Skill(skill="session-init")`. The skill owns its own missing-marker handling internally. If the skill returns an error, emit `BUNDLE: spec -> session-init (failed:<reason>)` and continue.
1. Clarify the problem (what, who, why, constraints)
```

Satisfies: AC-1, AC-11, AC-13.

---

### ship.md

**Phase**: postflight (after Step 4 "Create PR")

**Before** (current Step 5):
```markdown
5. Report: what shipped, PR link, any warnings
```

**After**:
```markdown
5. **Post-ship learnings**: After PR creation succeeds:
   - Emit `BUNDLE: ship -> session-end (invoked)`, then invoke `Skill(skill="session-end")` unconditionally. The skill owns its own missing-marker handling.
   - **Reflect with min-delta guard**: If the diff has 5 or more changed files, emit `BUNDLE: ship -> reflect (invoked)` and invoke `Skill(skill="reflect")`. Otherwise emit `BUNDLE: ship -> reflect (skipped:condition-not-met)` and continue.
   - If either skill returns an error, emit `BUNDLE: ship -> <skill> (failed:<reason>)` and continue.
6. Report: what shipped, PR link, any warnings
```

Satisfies: AC-2, AC-11, AC-13.

---

### plan.md

**Phase**: steps 6 and 7 (currently inline agent prompts)

**Before** (current Steps 6-7):
```markdown
6. Task(subagent_type="analyst"): You are a risk analyst. Run a pre-mortem on this plan. What fails first? What dependencies are fragile? What assumptions are untested?
7. Task(subagent_type="critic"): You are a plan reviewer. Validate: is scope complete? Can tasks execute in the stated sequence? Are estimates credible? Is anything missing?
```

**After**:
```markdown
6. **Pre-mortem**: Emit `BUNDLE: plan -> pre-mortem (invoked)`, then invoke `Skill(skill="pre-mortem")` on the plan produced in step 5. If the skill fails, emit `BUNDLE: plan -> pre-mortem (failed:<reason>)` and continue.
7. **Decision critic**: Emit `BUNDLE: plan -> decision-critic (invoked)`, then invoke `Skill(skill="decision-critic")` to challenge plan assumptions. If the skill fails, emit `BUNDLE: plan -> decision-critic (failed:<reason>)` and continue.
```

Satisfies: AC-3, AC-4, AC-11, AC-13.

---

### build.md

**Phase**: preflight (before "Complexity Assessment")

**Before** (current opening after frontmatter):
```markdown
## Complexity Assessment

Before implementation, Task(subagent_type="analyst"):...
```

**After**:
```markdown
## Preflight

Before any implementation work, run in order:

1. Emit `BUNDLE: build -> context-gather (invoked)`, then invoke `Skill(skill="context-gather")` to load Forgetful, Serena, Context7, and DeepWiki context for the current task.
2. Emit `BUNDLE: build -> steering-matcher (invoked)`, then invoke `Skill(skill="steering-matcher")` to load path-based rules from `.claude/rules/` for files in scope.
3. **Chesterton's Fence (conditional)**: Run `git log --format=%at -1 -- "<file>"` for each file in scope (paths MUST be quoted to prevent CWE-78 shell injection). If any file's last commit timestamp is older than six months, emit `BUNDLE: build -> chestertons-fence (invoked)` and invoke `Skill(skill="chestertons-fence")`. Otherwise emit `BUNDLE: build -> chestertons-fence (skipped:no-marker)`.

Each preflight skill has a 120-second timeout. On timeout: emit `BUNDLE: build -> <skill> (failed:timeout)` and continue.

If any preflight skill fails, emit `BUNDLE: build -> <skill> (failed:<reason>)` and continue.

## Complexity Assessment

Before implementation, Task(subagent_type="analyst"):...

## Technology Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Artifact type | Markdown hand-edits | No template generator for commands; verified `templates/commands/` does not exist. Direct edits match existing conventions. |
| Skill invocation syntax | `Skill(skill="<name>")` | Matches existing pattern in `spec.md:16,23,30`, `ship.md:17-21`, `review.md:24-26,39,49,63`. |
| BUNDLE marker format | Static text marker adjacent to `Skill(...)` call in the markdown | Parseable by both humans and the test file; no runtime stdout dependency; avoids structured logging overhead. |
| Presence-check method | `Read` or `Bash(test -f <literal-path>)` | CWE-78 prevention; no user-supplied path interpolation. |
| Conflict resolution | Closer-to-implementation invocation wins | E.g., `decision-critic` in `/spec` and `/plan` both invoke the same skill; no conflict because they are independent command runs. |
| Idempotency | `session-init` checks for existing log; `reflect` skips when no HIGH-confidence learnings | Handled inside the skills; command edits do not need idempotency guards. |

---

## Security Considerations

- No new attack surface. All skills are existing.
- Presence checks MUST use `Read` or `Bash(test -f <literal-path>)` only. MUST NOT interpolate `$ARGUMENTS` or any user input into shell commands.
- Markdown-only distribution. No executable content. No secrets.
- BUNDLE marker output MUST NOT include file contents, API keys, tokens, or PII in the `<reason>` field.

---

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | Artifact | What is verified |
|---|---|---|
| Static parse | `tests/test_command_bundles.py` | Each command file contains the `Skill(skill="...")` calls from the BundleRegistry. Parses markdown; does not execute commands. Tests use `xfail` marks for not-yet-edited rows so CI stays green during M1/M2. |
| Pre-PR advisory | `scripts/validation/pre_pr.py` (new check) | Same parser as test file; emits **advisory WARN** findings (not BLOCKING) for missing invocations. Gated behind `BUNDLE_CHECK_ENFORCED` env var (default `0`); `1` upgrades to BLOCKING in a future spec. |
| Shared registry | `scripts/validation/bundle_registry.py` | Single source of truth for BUNDLE_REGISTRY list, imported by both test and pre_pr.py. Avoids copy-paste drift between consumers. |
| Manual smoke | Run `/spec` and `/ship` on a clean repo | Verify `BUNDLE:` text appears in command file and skill invocations succeed. |
| CWE-78 check | `tests/test_command_bundles.py` | All git log commands in build.md and review.md quote file paths (independent regex grep, NOT shared with the bundle parser). |
