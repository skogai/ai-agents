# Code Quality

**Status**: Canonical Source for code quality norms

This file is the harness-neutral canonical source for baseline code quality in this
repository. It sets the standard for any code you write or change, regardless of
which harness (Claude Code, Copilot, Cortex, Factory Droid) is running. It merges
the everyday fundamentals from Robert Martin's _Clean Code_ and Steve McConnell's
_Code Complete_.

Apply these rules on every edit. They override stylistic preferences but defer to
project conventions in `AGENTS.md`, `.editorconfig`, and `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`.

The harness-scoped rule at `.claude/rules/code-quality.md` carries the same substance
for Claude Code agents and adds the worked examples. When the two disagree, this file
wins on the norm; the rule file wins on Claude-specific mechanics.

## Naming

Names are documentation. A reader who knows nothing about the change should
understand the code from the names alone.

- Choose intention-revealing names. `daysSinceLastLogin` beats `d` or `delta`.
- Use pronounceable, searchable names. `customerCount` beats `cc`.
- Drop abbreviations and Hungarian prefixes. `userList` beats `usrLst`.
- Use one word per concept across the whole codebase. Pick `fetch`, `get`, or
  `retrieve` and stay with it.
- Names track scope. Short names fit short scopes. Long names fit long-lived classes
  and public APIs.
- Class names are nouns. Method names are verbs. Boolean methods read as predicates:
  `isReady`, `hasChildren`, `canCommit`.
- Avoid disinformation. Do not call something `accountList` if it is a `Set`.
- Mirror the domain. If the team says "tenant," do not write `customer` in code.

When you find yourself writing a comment to explain a name, rename instead.

## Functions

Functions are the core unit of design. Keep them small, single-purpose, and easy to
test.

- Functions should do one thing. If you can describe the function as "X and Y," split
  it.
- Prefer 20 lines or fewer. The project ceiling is 60. Past that, extract.
- Aim for cyclomatic complexity of 10 or lower. Past that, extract or use
  table-driven logic.
- Limit parameters to three. Prefer two. Zero is best. Bundle related parameters into
  a parameter object.
- Avoid flag arguments. A boolean argument means the function does two things. Split
  it into `renderTextual()` and `renderHtml()`.
- Output parameters are confusing. Return a value, a tuple, or a small record.
- One level of abstraction per function. A high-level orchestrator should not parse
  strings; a parser should not log analytics.
- Apply the Stepdown Rule. Read top to bottom: each function calls the next level of
  detail.
- No side effects beyond the function's name. `validatePassword(user)` should not also
  log the user in.

If a function is hard to name, it does too much. Split it.

## Guard Clauses Over Deep Nesting

Deep `if`/`else` trees hide intent. Use early returns to flatten control flow. Bail on
the unhappy path first. Keep the happy path on the leftmost indent level. This pattern
also localizes preconditions next to the inputs they check.

## Delete Dead Code

Commented-out code rots. Remove it. The version control history is the archive.

- Delete unreachable branches, unused imports, and stale parameters.
- Delete TODOs that have outlived their context. Open an issue if the work still
  matters.
- Delete commented-out blocks. If you are unsure, run a search across the repo first;
  then delete.
- Delete unused public APIs once you confirm no internal callers exist. External
  consumers belong behind a deprecation notice.

A reader trusts the code in front of them. Dead code teaches readers to distrust
everything they read.

## Code Smell Detection

Treat smells as evidence, not verdicts. They flag places worth a closer look.

- **Long Method**: extract until each method fits one screen.
- **Large Class**: split by responsibility.
- **Long Parameter List**: introduce a parameter object or builder.
- **Duplicate Code**: extract a function or use a shared helper. The Rule of Three:
  duplicate twice, refactor on the third occurrence.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that uses another class's data more than its own belongs
  on that other class.
- **Data Clumps**: the same group of fields traveling together usually wants to be a
  type.
- **Primitive Obsession**: replace `string customerId` with a `CustomerId` type when
  the value carries rules.
- **Switch Statements on Type**: replace with polymorphism or a strategy table.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change touching many files signals weak cohesion.
  Consolidate the responsibility.
- **Comments Explaining What**: rename or extract until the comment becomes redundant.
  Reserve comments for _why_.

When you smell something, name it explicitly in the PR description so reviewers can see
your reasoning.

## SOLID

SOLID protects code from change-driven decay. Apply at the unit boundary.

- **Single Responsibility**: a class has one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed**: open to extension, closed to modification.
- **Liskov Substitution**: subtypes must be usable wherever the parent is used. Prefer
  composition.
- **Interface Segregation**: clients should not depend on methods they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion**: depend on abstractions, not concretes.

Apply SOLID where change is likely. Premature abstraction is its own smell.

## Test Readability

Tests are first-class code. They document behavior. Treat them with the same care.

- Use the Arrange/Act/Assert structure. One blank line between sections.
- One behavior per test. A failing test should localize the bug.
- Names describe the behavior, not the method. `creditsAccountWhenBalanceIsPositive`
  beats `testCredit1`.
- Prefer Given/When/Then phrasing for integration tests.
- Build inputs with named factories or builders.
- Assert on outcomes, not internals.
- Keep test data minimal. Each value in the setup should matter to the assertion.
- Tests should fail for one reason.

If you cannot write a test, the design is wrong. Fix the design first.

## Defensive Programming

Assume bad input can reach your function. Decide where to catch it, then catch it once.

- Validate inputs at the boundary. Internal functions trust their callers; public APIs
  do not.
- Use assertions for conditions that should be impossible. Use exceptions for
  conditions that are merely invalid.
- Fail fast. A function with a contract violation should raise on the first detection,
  not log and continue.
- Check pre-conditions, then post-conditions. Document both in the function header.
- Treat all external data as hostile until validated: HTTP request bodies, environment
  variables, file contents, database rows from older schemas.
- Never trust user-supplied identifiers as authorization. Re-check ownership inside the
  function.
- Choose one error-handling strategy per layer: exceptions, result types, or sentinel
  values. Mixing them inside one layer creates ambiguity.
- Log enough context to reconstruct the failure: input identifiers, user, request id.
  Never log secrets, tokens, or full PII.

Defensive code should not become paranoid code. If two callers already validated the
input, a third check is noise.

## Table-Driven Logic

When branching grows past three or four cases, replace conditional code with a table.

- Map known inputs to outputs in a dictionary or array.
- Add a default case for unknown inputs. Decide explicitly: raise, log, or fall back.
- Tables make changes localized. Adding a new case is a one-line edit, not a new
  branch.
- Tables make tests parametrize cleanly. Each row becomes one test case.

Use table-driven logic for command dispatch, status transitions, validation rules, and
feature flags. Avoid it when the cases differ in structure, not just data; polymorphism
fits better there.

## Variable Scope and Lifetime

Minimize the distance between a variable's declaration and its last use.

- Declare variables at the smallest scope that satisfies their use.
- Initialize at the point of declaration. Avoid declared-then-assigned-later patterns.
- Prefer immutability. Reassignment is a smell unless the loop variable is the point.
- Reduce live variables.
- Avoid global mutable state. Where you cannot, document the invariants and guard the
  writers.
- Pull constants out of methods only when they are reused.

A short scope is easier to reason about. A short scope makes refactoring safe.

## Comments

Code explains _what_. Comments explain _why_.

- Write comments when the rationale would surprise a peer reader: a hidden invariant, a
  workaround for a vendor bug, a non-obvious performance choice.
- Do not narrate the code.
- Do not date-stamp or sign comments. Git already records that.
- Reference issues and ADRs when the rationale lives elsewhere.
- Update or delete comments when the code under them changes. A wrong comment is worse
  than no comment.

If you must comment to explain a function, the function probably wants a better name or
a smaller body.

## Error Handling

Errors are part of the contract. Handle them with the same care as the happy path.

- Define what each function does on failure: returns, raises, or both.
- Do not swallow exceptions. If you catch one, you have a reason; record the reason in
  code or in a log.
- Wrap low-level errors with domain-meaningful types at the boundary so callers do not
  depend on infrastructure details.
- Use `try`/`finally` (or its language equivalent) for resource cleanup. Prefer
  language constructs (`with`, `using`, `defer`) when available.
- Never use exceptions for normal control flow. They are slow and hide intent.
- Re-raise to preserve the stack. A new exception with no cause loses the trail.

A function that fails predictably is easier to operate than one that succeeds
unpredictably.

## Quick Self-Review

Before you mark work complete, walk this list:

- [ ] Names tell the reader what the code does without comments.
- [ ] Each function does one thing. Cyclomatic complexity is 10 or lower. Length is 60
      lines or fewer.
- [ ] No commented-out code. No dead branches.
- [ ] Guard clauses are at the top. The happy path is on the leftmost column.
- [ ] Inputs are validated at the boundary, not at every layer.
- [ ] Long branching uses tables when shapes match; polymorphism when they do not.
- [ ] Tests describe behavior, follow Arrange/Act/Assert, and would catch a regression.
- [ ] Variables live in the narrowest scope that satisfies their use.
- [ ] Comments explain _why_; the code explains _what_.
- [ ] Errors are typed, traced, and logged without secrets.
- [ ] Mandatory security patterns (CWE-22 path traversal, CWE-78 command injection,
      authentication and authorization boundaries, secret handling) are checked.

If you cannot check a box, fix it before requesting review. The cost of a fix grows
after the merge.
