# ADR-NNN: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Date

[YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context

[Describe the problem, forces at play, and why a decision is needed. Be specific about what is driving this decision.]

## Decision

[State the decision that was made. Be clear and unambiguous.]

## Prior Art Investigation (Required when changing existing systems)

Complete this section when the ADR proposes changes to existing patterns, constraints, or architecture.
Use `python3 .claude/skills/chestertons-fence/scripts/investigate.py` to automate research.

### What Currently Exists

- **Structure/pattern being changed**: [Describe what exists today]
- **When introduced**: [PR/ADR reference, commit, date]
- **Original author and context**: [Who created it and why]

### Historical Rationale

- **Why was it built this way?** [Original problem it solved]
- **What alternatives were considered?** [Prior trade-off analysis]
- **What constraints drove the design?** [Technical or organizational factors]

### Why Change Now

- **Has the original problem changed?** [Yes/No, evidence]
- **Is there a better solution now?** [Yes/No, what changed]
- **What are the risks of change?** [Blast radius, migration cost]

## Rationale

[Explain why this decision was made. Include:]
