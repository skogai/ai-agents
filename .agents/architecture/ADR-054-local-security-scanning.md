# ADR-054: Local Security Scanning

**Status**: Accepted (amended 2026-05-02)
**Date**: 2026-02-19
**Deciders**: Security Agent, DevOps Agent
**Context**: Pre-push security scanning to complement CI-based CodeQL

## Amendment 2026-05-02: CWE-22 scope narrowing for the `security-scan` skill

Scope of this amendment: the internal `security-scan` skill at `.claude/skills/security-scan/scripts/scan_vulnerabilities.py`. This is a SEPARATE tool from the semgrep pre-push hook described in the Decision and Implementation sections below. The skill is a regex-based scanner invoked manually or by Claude during code review; the semgrep hook runs in `.githooks/pre-push`. Both fall under the broader "local security scanning" umbrella.

Change: the skill no longer detects CWE-22 (path traversal). CWE-22 detection is delegated to CodeQL's `python-security-extended.qls` query suite, which runs on every PR via `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`. The skill remains in scope for CWE-78 (command injection).

Rationale: PR #1841 demonstrated that the regex CWE-22 patterns generated false positives on safe `Path(__file__)` derivations (seven inline suppression annotations were added across three files to silence them). A buy-vs-build analysis (issue #1843) confirmed CodeQL's taint-tracking dataflow is a strict superset of what the regex caught for CWE-22, and the regex's substring-on-variable-name heuristic missed real attacker-controlled paths anyway. Path-traversal detection is Context (table stakes), not a competitive differentiator; CodeQL is the right tool.

What this amendment does NOT change:

- The semgrep pre-push hook (`scripts/security/run_semgrep.py`) is untouched. Whatever CWE-22 patterns its `--config auto` ruleset matches continue to fire.
- ADR-054's core decision (run lightweight security scanning before push) is intact.
- The pre-push performance budget (1-5 seconds for the semgrep hook) is unchanged.

Authoritative scope statement for the skill: see `.claude/skills/security-scan/SKILL.md` `## Scope`.

## Context and Problem Statement

PR #908 demonstrated that security findings discovered in CI (CodeQL CWE-22 path traversal) create significant overhead:

1. **Late feedback**: Findings appear after PR creation, not during development
2. **Review noise**: Security comments pollute PR threads
3. **Wasted cycles**: Reviewers spend time on issues that could be caught locally
4. **Slower iteration**: Developers must context-switch back to fix security issues

The existing pre-push hook (`.githooks/pre-push`) runs 18 checks across 5 phases, including lint, type checks, tests, and governance validation. However, it lacks security scanning for actual vulnerabilities.

ADR-041 established CodeQL integration with a multi-tier strategy. Tier 1 (CI/CD) provides enforcement. Tier 2 (local) and Tier 3 (automatic PostToolUse) are optional developer conveniences. Neither tier runs in the pre-push hook.

**Key Question**: Should all PRs with code changes run local security scans before push?

## Decision

Extend the pre-push hook to run lightweight security scanning on changed code files.

**Tool choice**: semgrep (preferred) or bandit as fallback.

**Rationale for tool selection**:
- **semgrep**: Fast (1-5 seconds), cross-language, supports Python/PowerShell/JS/TS/YAML, simple CLI
- **bandit**: Python-only but zero dependencies, well-established
- **CodeQL CLI**: Too slow for pre-push (30-60 seconds minimum), requires database build

**Scope**: Changed files only (consistent with existing pre-push patterns).

**Threshold**: Fail on HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Warn on MEDIUM.

**Bypass**: Standard `--no-verify` with documented justification requirement.

### Implementation

Phase 5 (Security & Governance) of `.githooks/pre-push` delegates to
`scripts/security/run_semgrep.py`, which owns file discovery, severity
classification, and exit-code handling.

The script:

1. Detects changed files via `git diff --name-only` against the merge-base with `origin/main`
2. Filters to supported extensions: `.py`, `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.yaml`, `.yml`
3. Runs `semgrep scan --config auto --json --no-git-ignore` on matched files
4. Classifies findings by severity (ERROR = HIGH/CRITICAL, WARNING = MEDIUM)
5. Blocks on ERROR findings only. Warns on WARNING findings without blocking.

Pre-push hook integration:

```bash
# 15.5. Security scan (semgrep)
if [ -n "$CHANGED_PY" ] || [ -n "$CHANGED_PS" ] || [ -n "$CHANGED_JS" ] || [ -n "$CHANGED_YAML" ]; then
    if command -v semgrep &> /dev/null; then
        if python3 scripts/security/run_semgrep.py; then
            record_pass "Security scan/semgrep"
        else
            SEMGREP_EXIT=$?
            if [ "$SEMGREP_EXIT" -eq 1 ]; then
                record_fail "Security scan found HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities"
            elif [ "$SEMGREP_EXIT" -eq 2 ]; then
                record_skip "Security scan (configuration error)"
            else
                record_fail "Security scan (unexpected exit: $SEMGREP_EXIT)"
            fi
        fi
    else
        record_skip "Security scan (semgrep not installed)"
    fi
else
    record_skip "Security scan (no code files changed)"
fi
```

### Installation

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#security-scanning) for semgrep installation and usage instructions.

## Rationale

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why Not Chosen |
|-------------|------|------|----------------|
| Status quo (CI-only) | No local setup | PR #908 proves late feedback is costly | Delays feedback loop |
| CodeQL CLI in pre-push | Comprehensive coverage | 30-60s minimum, requires database | Too slow for pre-push |
| bandit only | Zero dependencies | Python-only, misses PowerShell | Incomplete coverage |
| semgrep + bandit | Defense in depth | Redundant for Python, slower | Diminishing returns |
| IDE-only (extensions) | No hook friction | Not enforced, inconsistent | Optional = often skipped |

### Trade-offs

**Speed vs. Coverage**: semgrep scans 10-100x faster than CodeQL at the cost of fewer rules. CI retains comprehensive CodeQL scanning for defense in depth.

**Optional Tool vs. Required**: semgrep installation is recommended but not required. The hook skips gracefully if unavailable, matching existing patterns (ruff, mypy, actionlint).

**Changed Files vs. Full Repo**: Scanning only changed files trades completeness for speed. New vulnerabilities in unchanged code remain CI's responsibility.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Shift-left security**: Catch CWE-22, CWE-78, CWE-079 in 1-5 seconds
2. **Cleaner PRs**: Security findings fixed before PR creation
3. **Faster iteration**: Local feedback loop
4. **Developer education**: Immediate exposure to secure coding patterns
5. **Reduced review noise**: Fewer security comments in PR threads

### Negative

1. **Tool installation**: Requires semgrep (pip or brew)
   - **Mitigation**: Clear installation docs, graceful skip if missing
2. **False positives**: May flag safe patterns
   - **Mitigation**: `# nosemgrep` suppression with justification
3. **Push friction**: Adds 1-5 seconds to push workflow
   - **Mitigation**: Only scans changed files, async display

### Neutral

1. **CI redundancy**: CodeQL continues running in CI
   - **Rationale**: Defense in depth, different rule sets
2. **Bypass available**: `--no-verify` remains an escape hatch
   - **Mitigation**: Document justification requirement in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Budget

| Check | Target | Actual |
|-------|--------|--------|
| semgrep scan (10 files) | <5s | ~2s |
| Pre-push total | <60s | ~45s |

### Exit Code Handling

Per ADR-035:
- Exit 0: No findings
- Exit 1: Findings found (blocking)
- Exit 2: Tool error (non-blocking skip)

### Integration with ADR-041

This ADR complements ADR-041's multi-tier strategy:

| Tier | Tool | Trigger | Speed | Coverage |
|------|------|---------|-------|----------|
| 1 (CI) | CodeQL | PR push | 2-5 min | Comprehensive |
| 2 (Local) | CodeQL CLI | Developer-initiated | 30-60s | Comprehensive |
| 3 (Auto) | CodeQL | PostToolUse hook | 5-15s | Quick queries |
| **4 (Pre-push)** | **semgrep** | **git push** | **1-5s** | **Fast OWASP** |

### Suppression Patterns
