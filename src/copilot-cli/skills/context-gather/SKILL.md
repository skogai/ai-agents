Use the **context-retrieval** subagent to gather context for the following task:

{TASK_DESCRIPTION}

The context-retrieval subagent will:

- Search Forgetful Memory across ALL projects for relevant patterns, decisions, and code
- Read linked code artifacts and documents
- Query Context7 for framework-specific guidance if applicable
- Explore the knowledge graph to find connected patterns
- Return a focused summary with code snippets and architectural insights

Wait for the subagent to return its findings before proceeding.
