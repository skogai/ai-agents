# Research and Incorporate Workflow

Detailed phase workflows with templates, verification checkpoints, and tool usage patterns.

---

## Execution Principles

Complete the workflow systematically. Focus on:

- **Depth over breadth**: Thorough analysis of core concepts, not surface coverage
- **Concrete examples over abstract theory**: Every principle needs real-world demonstration
- **Integration with ai-agents project**: Every insight must show applicability

Do what is required for each phase; nothing more, nothing less.

---

## Phase 1: Research and Context Gathering (BLOCKING)

### Pre-Work: Existing Knowledge Check

**Before external research, analyze existing project context:**

```python
# Search Forgetful for related concepts
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("query_memory", {
    "query": "{TOPIC} related concepts principles",
    "query_context": "Researching {TOPIC} for integration"
})

# Check Serena project memories
mcp__serena__list_memories()
# Read any relevant memories found
```

**Questions to answer:**

- What does ai-agents already know about this topic?
- What related patterns exist in the codebase? (ADRs, protocols, skills)
- How does this topic connect to current work?

This prevents duplication and ensures new knowledge integrates with existing understanding.

### External Research

**If URLs provided, fetch with TWO-STEP analysis:**

**Step 1 - Extract quotes (grounding):**

```python
WebFetch(url, prompt="Find quotes relevant to {TOPIC}. Extract verbatim text in <quotes> tags.")
```

**Step 2 - Analyze quotes (reasoning):**

Based ONLY on the quotes extracted above, identify:

- Core principles mentioned
- Frameworks or models described
- Examples provided
- Relationships to other concepts noted

**Web searches to perform:**

- "{TOPIC} definition principles"
- "{TOPIC} practical applications examples"
- "{TOPIC} software engineering"
- "{TOPIC} decision frameworks"

### Normal Research Failures (Handle Without Apologizing)

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| URL returns 404 or paywall | Note unavailability, use alternative sources |
| WebSearch returns limited results | Refine query or proceed with available information |
| Source contradicts another source | Document both perspectives, note disagreement |

These are expected research conditions, not errors requiring user notification.

### Synthesis Requirements (MUST include all)

- Core principles and foundational concepts
- Practical frameworks or models
- Real-world applications with concrete examples
- Common failure modes and anti-patterns
- Relationships to other methodologies or principles

### Phase 1 Verification

```xml
<phase_1_verification>
- Do I understand core principles? (Can I explain to original author?)
- Do I have 3+ concrete examples with context?
- Have I identified minimum 3 failure modes?
- Do I understand relationships to 2+ existing concepts?
</phase_1_verification>
```

**If any verification fails, return to research. Do not proceed with incomplete understanding.**

## Phase 2: Deep Analysis Document (BLOCKING)

### File Location

`.agents/analysis/{topic-slug}.md`

### Document Structure

Create sections as needed for the topic, but MUST include:

```markdown
# {Topic Name}: Analysis

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD | **Context**: {CONTEXT} | **Sources**: [URLs]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraphs: essence, why it matters, key takeaways]

## Core Concepts

```

**Note**: Organize for clarity, not template compliance. If the topic doesn't have "historical context," don't force it. Focus on what matters.

### Quality Gates (BLOCKING)

| Gate | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Word count | 3000-5000 words minimum |
| Examples | Minimum 3 concrete examples with context |
| Failure modes | Minimum 3 identified |
| Relationships | Minimum 2 related concepts mapped |
| Actionable guidance | Implementation recommendations included |

### Phase 2 Verification

```xml
<phase_2_verification>
- Is analysis comprehensive? (3000-5000 words)
- Are examples concrete? (Not generic scenarios)
- Are failure modes specific? (Not vague warnings)
- Are relationships explicit? (Clear connections, not hand-waving)
</phase_2_verification>
```

**If any verification fails, return to Phase 2. Do not proceed with surface-level analysis.**

---

## Phase 3: Applicability Assessment (BLOCKING)

### Analysis Areas

**1. Agent System Integration:**

- Which agents could benefit from this knowledge?
- Should this inform agent prompts or workflows?
- Does this suggest new agent responsibilities?

**2. Protocol and Process:**

- Does this improve session protocols?
- Should this inform handoff procedures?
- Does this enhance quality gates?

**3. Memory and Knowledge Management:**

- Does this inform how we store knowledge?
- Should this guide memory architecture decisions?
- Does this improve knowledge retrieval patterns?

**4. Constraint and Governance:**

- Should this become a project constraint?
- Does this inform ADR review processes?
- Should this guide decision-making protocols?

**5. Skills and Automation:**

- Could this be encoded in a skill?
- Does this suggest new automation patterns?
- Should this inform script design?

### Document in Analysis

Add section to analysis document:

```markdown
## Applicability to ai-agents Project

### Integration Points

#### Agent System
[Specific agents and how they could use this]

#### Protocols
[Session protocol, handoff protocol enhancements]

#### Memory Architecture
[How this informs Serena/Forgetful usage]

#### Skills and Automation
[Concrete skill enhancement opportunities]

### Proposed Applications

1. **[Application 1]**
   - **What**: [specific change or addition]
   - **Where**: [files/agents/protocols affected]
   - **Why**: [benefit and connection to concept]
   - **Effort**: [estimate: trivial/small/medium/large]

2. **[Application 2]**
   [Same structure]

### Priority Assessment

**High Priority**: [applications that align with current objectives]
**Medium Priority**: [valuable but not urgent]
**Low Priority**: [nice-to-have enhancements]
```

### Phase 3 Verification

```xml
<phase_3_verification>
- Have I identified specific integration points? (Not generic possibilities)
- Are applications concrete? (File paths, agent names, protocol sections)
- Is priority justified? (Based on project goals, not opinion)
</phase_3_verification>
```

**If any verification fails, return to Phase 3. Do not proceed without clear applicability.**

```python
mcp__serena__write_memory(
    memory_file_name="{topic-slug}-integration",
    content="""# {Topic Name} Integration

## Core Insight

"""
)
```

### 4B: Forgetful Atomic Memories

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Create 5-10 atomic memories

**Each memory MUST satisfy (RULE 0)**:

| Constraint | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| **Atomic** | ONE concept per memory (not a grab-bag of loosely related ideas) |
| **Constrained** | <2000 characters maximum (content field only) |
| **Actionable** | Include pattern/example/pitfall, not just theory |
| **Linked** | Connect to related existing memories (auto-linking + manual) |

Violating these constraints creates unusable memories that pollute the knowledge graph.

**Memory Categories** (create 1-2 from each relevant category):

1. Core definition and principle
2. Primary framework or model
3. Key application pattern
4. Critical failure mode
5. Relationship to existing concept
6. Implementation guidance
7. Concrete example with lesson
8. Anti-pattern with correction
9. Decision-making heuristic
10. Integration with project patterns

**Template for Each:**

```python
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("create_memory", {
    "title": "{Specific Concept from Topic}",
    "content": """[Atomic explanation of ONE concept]

Context: [When this applies]
Pattern: [How to recognize/apply]
Example: [Concrete instance]
Pitfall: [What to avoid]
Connection: [Link to other concepts]""",
    "context": "Researched {TOPIC} for ai-agents project integration - {CONTEXT}",
    "keywords": ["{topic}", "related-keyword-1", "related-keyword-2", "domain"],
    "tags": ["research", "principles", "patterns", "{domain}"],
    "importance": 8  # 7-10 for strategic knowledge
})
```

### 4C: Link Related Memories

After creating all memories:

```python
# Query to find related existing memories
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("query_memory", {
    "query": "{related-concept}",
    "query_context": "Finding memories to link with {TOPIC}"
})

# Link new memories to each other and existing ones
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("link_memories", {
    "memory_id": [new_memory_id],
    "related_ids": [related_id_1, related_id_2, ...]
})
```

### 4D: Skill Enhancement (if applicable)

If topic enhances an existing skill:

1. Read current skill prompt
2. Identify integration point
3. Add new section documenting concept application
4. Update with concrete examples
5. Document in commit message

---

## Phase 5: Action Items

### If Implementation Work Identified

Create GitHub issue:

```bash
# Verify branch first
git branch --show-current

# Create issue with detailed description
gh issue create \
    --title "[Enhancement] Apply {TOPIC} to {integration-area}" \
    --body "## Context

## Next Steps

[What should happen next - implementation, review, discussion]
```

---

## Token Efficiency

**Reuse Over Recreation:**

- Reference analysis document in memories (don't duplicate content)
- Link memories instead of repeating explanations
- Create atomic memories that combine in queries (not monolithic dumps)

**Strategic Importance Scoring:**

| Score | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Foundational principles that inform multiple systems |
| 9 | Critical frameworks that guide major decisions |
| 8 | Practical patterns with broad applicability |
| 7 | Specific applications with clear value |
