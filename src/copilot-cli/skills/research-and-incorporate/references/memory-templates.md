# Memory Templates

Templates for creating atomic Forgetful memories from research.

---

## Atomic Memory Principles

Each memory must pass the atomicity test:

1. Can you understand it at first glance?
2. Can you title it in 5-50 words?
3. Does it represent ONE concept/fact/decision?

### Constraints

| Field | Limit | Guidance |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Title | 200 chars | Short, searchable phrase |
| Content | 2000 chars | Single concept (~300-400 words) |
| Context | 500 chars | WHY this matters |
| Keywords | 10 max | For semantic clustering |
| Tags | 10 max | For categorization |

## Importance Scoring Guide

| Score | Use For | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|

| 8 | Practical patterns with broad applicability | Application patterns, failure modes |
| 7 | Specific applications with clear value | Relationships, niche applications |

## Linking Strategy

After creating memories:

1. **Auto-linking**: Forgetful automatically links memories with cosine similarity ≥0.7
2. **Manual linking**: Connect related memories that auto-linking might miss

```python
# Query for related memories
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("query_memory", {
    "query": "{related-concept}",
    "query_context": "Finding memories to link with {TOPIC}"
})

# Link memories bidirectionally
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("link_memories", {
    "memory_id": new_memory_id,
    "related_ids": [id1, id2, id3]
})
```

**Link when:**

- Concepts are complementary (use together)
- Concepts are alternatives (choose between)
- Concepts share a domain
- One concept implements another
