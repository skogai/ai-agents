# ADR Review

Multi-agent debate pattern for rigorous ADR validation. Orchestrates 6 specialized agents through structured review rounds until consensus or 10 rounds maximum.

## Triggers

| Trigger Phrase | Operation |
|----------------|-----------|
| `review this ADR` | Full 6-agent debate on specified ADR |
| `validate ADR-005` | Targeted review of specific ADR by number |
| `check architecture decision` | ADR review with debate protocol |
| `ADR file created or modified` | Auto-triggered via detect_adr_changes.py |
| `delete ADR-NNN` | Deletion workflow (D1-D4) |

---

## Quick Start

```text
# Manual triggers:
/adr-review .agents/architecture/ADR-005-api-versioning.md
"review this ADR"
"validate ADR-005"
```

**Automatic Detection**: A Claude Code hook runs at session start and detects ADR changes, prompting you to invoke this skill. The pre-commit hook also detects staged ADR files and displays a reminder.

| Input | Output | Consensus Required |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| ADR file path | Debate log + Updated ADR | 6/6 Accept or D&C |

## File Triggers

| Pattern | Location | Events |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `ADR-*.md` | `.agents/architecture/` | create, update, delete |
| `ADR-*.md` | `docs/architecture/` | create, update, delete |
| `SESSION-PROTOCOL.md` | `.agents/` | create, update, delete |

**Detection**: `.claude/skills/adr-review/scripts/detect_adr_changes.py`

## When to Use

**MANDATORY Triggers** (automatic):

- Architect creates or updates an ADR
- ANY agent modifies `.agents/architecture/ADR-*.md`
- ANY agent modifies `.agents/SESSION-PROTOCOL.md`

**User-Initiated Triggers** (manual):

- User requests ADR review ("review this ADR", "validate this decision")
- User requests multi-perspective validation for strategic decisions

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Focus | Tie-Breaker Role |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **architect** | Structure, governance, coherence, ADR compliance | Structural questions |
| **critic** | Gaps, risks, alignment, completeness | None |
| **independent-thinker** | Challenge assumptions, surface contrarian views | None |
| **security** | Threat models, security trade-offs | None |
| **analyst** | Root cause, evidence, feasibility | None |
| **high-level-advisor** | Priority, resolve conflicts, break ties | Decision paralysis |

## Process

| Phase | Purpose | Details |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Phase 0** | Related work research | Search issues/PRs for context |
| **Phase 1** | Independent review | Each agent reviews ADR using [Zimmermann 7-question checklist](references/zimmermann-review-guidance.md) |
| **Phase 2** | Consolidation | Identify consensus and conflicts; flag [review anti-patterns](references/zimmermann-review-guidance.md) |
| **Phase 3** | Resolution | Propose updates for P0/P1 issues |
| **Phase 4** | Convergence check | Agents vote: Accept/D&C/Block |

**Consensus**: All 6 agents Accept OR Disagree-and-Commit. Max 10 rounds.

See [references/debate-protocol.md](references/debate-protocol.md) for full phase details.

## Deletion Workflow

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **D1** | Detection - identify deleted ADR |
| **D2** | Impact assessment - find dependencies |
| **D3** | Archival decision - archive accepted ADRs |
| **D4** | Cleanup - update references |

See [references/deletion-workflow.md](references/deletion-workflow.md) for full workflow.

## Issue Resolution

| Priority | Requirement | Gate |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **P0** | Must resolve | BLOCKING |
| **P1** | Resolve OR defer with issue | BLOCKING |
| **P2** | Document | Non-blocking |

See [references/issue-resolution.md](references/issue-resolution.md) for deferral protocol.

## Phase 4: Strategic Review (Principal-Level Validation)

After structural and technical review, apply strategic lenses:

### Strategic Validation Checklist

#### Chesterton's Fence (Change Justification)

- [ ] If removing/changing existing patterns: Original purpose documented
- [ ] Investigation evidence provided (git archaeology, interviews, documentation)
- [ ] Confirmation original problem no longer exists
- [ ] Assessment: [PASS | FAIL | N/A]

#### Path Dependence (Irreversibility Recognition)

- [ ] Historical constraints identified and documented
- [ ] Reversibility assessment complete (rollback capability, vendor lock-in)
- [ ] Migration/exit strategy defined if adding dependencies
- [ ] Irreversible decisions explicitly flagged and justified
- [ ] Assessment: [PASS | FAIL | N/A]

#### Core vs Context (Investment Prioritization)

- [ ] Capability classified as Core (differentiating) or Context (commodity)
- [ ] If building Context: Justification for not buying/outsourcing
- [ ] If Core: Competitive differentiation explained
- [ ] Assessment: [PASS | FAIL | N/A]

#### Second-System Effect (Over-Engineering Detection)

- [ ] If replacing existing system: Scope boundaries explicit
- [ ] Feature list justified (not "everything we didn't do last time")
- [ ] Simplicity preservation strategy documented
- [ ] Assessment: [PASS | FAIL | N/A]

### Strategic Review Verdict

**Overall Strategic Assessment**: [APPROVED | CONCERNS | REJECTED]

**Blocking Issues**:

- [Strategic issue 1 with required mitigation]
- [Strategic issue 2 with required mitigation]

**Recommendations**:

- [Strategic improvement 1]
- [Strategic improvement 2]

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `detect_adr_changes.py` | Detect ADR file changes for auto-trigger |

```bash
# Basic detection
python3 .claude/skills/adr-review/scripts/detect_adr_changes.py

# Compare to specific commit
python3 .claude/skills/adr-review/scripts/detect_adr_changes.py --since-commit abc123

# Include untracked ADR files
python3 .claude/skills/adr-review/scripts/detect_adr_changes.py --include-untracked
```

## Verification Checklist

After skill invocation:

- [ ] Debate log exists at `.agents/critique/ADR-NNN-debate-log.md`
- [ ] ADR status updated (proposed/accepted/needs-revision)
- [ ] All P0 issues addressed or documented
- [ ] Dissent captured for Disagree-and-Commit positions
- [ ] Recommendations provided to orchestrator

## Anti-Patterns

### Process Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Single-agent ADR review | Misses domain expertise | Use full 6-agent debate |
| Skipping Phase 0 | Duplicates existing work | Always research first |
| Ignoring D&C dissent | Loses important context | Document all reservations |
| Manual ADR monitoring | Error-prone | Use detect_adr_changes.py |
| Deleting accepted ADRs without archive | Loses knowledge | Always archive accepted ADRs |

### Review Anti-Patterns (Zimmermann)

Each agent should self-check against these. Phase 2 consolidation flags violations.

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Detection |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Pass Through** | Few/no comments, document barely read | Agent produces no substantive findings |
| **Copy Edit** | Focuses on wording, ignores content | All findings editorial, none architectural |
| **Siding/Dead End** | Comments switch topic, deviate from ADR | Agent drifts from decision at hand |
| **Self Promotion** | Recommends reviewer's preferred solution | Agent pushes technology without objective rationale |
| **Power Game** | Authority claims instead of technical arguments | Agent uses position over evidence |
| **Offended Reaction** | Defends criticized position subjectively | Agent reacts emotionally to rationale |
| **Groundhog Day** | Same message repeated across rounds | Agent re-raises resolved issues |
