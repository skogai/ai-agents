# Curating Memories

Active curation keeps the knowledge base accurate and connected. Outdated memories pollute search results and reduce effectiveness.

## Triggers

| Trigger Phrase | Operation |
|----------------|-----------|
| `how do I update a memory` | update_memory with PATCH semantics |
| `how do I mark a memory obsolete` | mark_memory_obsolete with reason |
| `how do I link related memories` | link_memories bidirectional linking |
| `how do I deduplicate memories` | Curation workflow: query, analyze, merge |
| `how do I clean up stale memories` | Identify and mark obsolete outdated content |

---

## When to Update a Memory

Use `update_memory` when:

- Information needs correction or clarification
- Importance level changes (more/less relevant than thought)
- Content needs refinement
- Links to projects/artifacts/documents change

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("update_memory", {
  "memory_id": <id>,
  "content": "Updated content...",
  "importance": 8
})
```

Only specified fields are changed (PATCH semantics).

## When to Mark Obsolete

Use `mark_memory_obsolete` when:

- Memory is outdated or contradicted by newer information
- Decision has been reversed or superseded
- Referenced code/feature no longer exists
- Memory was created in error

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("mark_memory_obsolete", {
  "memory_id": <id>,
  "reason": "Superseded by new architecture decision",
  "superseded_by": <new_memory_id>  // optional
})
```

Obsolete memories are soft-deleted (preserved for audit, hidden from queries).

## When to Link Memories

Use `link_memories` when:

- Concepts are related but not caught by auto-linking
- Building explicit knowledge graph structure
- Connecting decisions to their implementations
- Relating patterns across projects

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("link_memories", {
  "memory_id": <source_id>,
  "related_ids": [<target_id_1>, <target_id_2>]
})
```

Links are bidirectional (A↔B created automatically).

## Curation Workflow

When creating new memories, check impact on existing knowledge:

### Step 1: Query Related Memories

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("query_memory", {
  "query": "<topic of new memory>",
  "query_context": "Checking for memories that may need curation",
  "k": 5
})
```

### Step 2: Analyze Each Result

For each existing memory, determine action:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Existing memory is still accurate | Link to it |
| Existing memory has minor gaps | Update it |
| Existing memory is now wrong | Mark obsolete, create new |
| Existing memory is partially valid | Create new, link both |

### Step 3: Execute Curation Plan

Present plan to user before executing:

```text
Curation plan:
- Create: "New authentication approach" (importance: 8)
- Mark obsolete: #42 "Old auth pattern" (superseded)
- Link: New memory ↔ #38 "Security requirements"

Proceed? (y/n)
```

### Step 4: Execute and Report

After user confirms:

1. Create new memory
2. Mark obsolete memories
3. Create links
4. Report results with all changes made

## Signs of Poor Curation

Watch for these indicators:

- Multiple similar memories on same topic (deduplicate)
- Memories referencing deleted code (mark obsolete)
- Contradictory memories (resolve conflict)
- Low-importance memories (importance < 6) accumulating
- Orphaned memories with no links (consider linking or removing)

## Auto-Linking

Forgetful auto-links semantically similar memories (similarity >= 0.7) during creation. Manual linking is for:

- Explicit relationships auto-linking missed
- Cross-project connections
- Non-obvious conceptual links

Check `similar_memories` in create response to see what was auto-linked.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Existing memories need correction or updated content
- New information supersedes an older memory
- Building explicit links between related knowledge
- Duplicate memories need consolidation
- Referenced code or features no longer exist

Use [using-forgetful-memory](../using-forgetful-memory/SKILL.md) instead when:

- Creating new memories from scratch
- Learning Forgetful tool parameters and constraints

Use [exploring-knowledge-graph](../exploring-knowledge-graph/SKILL.md) instead when:

- Traversing entity relationships for comprehensive context
- Investigating cross-project connections

---

## Process

1. Search for the target memory using `query_memory`
2. Evaluate whether the memory needs updating, linking, or marking obsolete
3. Apply the appropriate curation operation
4. Verify the change took effect

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Deleting memories instead of marking obsolete | Loses audit trail | Use mark_memory_obsolete with reason |
| Creating duplicates of existing memories | Pollutes search results | Query first, update existing if found |
| Linking everything to everything | Dilutes relationship signal | Link only semantically meaningful connections |
| Skipping user confirmation on curation plans | May obsolete valuable content | Present plan and wait for approval |
| Ignoring low-importance memory accumulation | Degrades search quality over time | Periodically review and cull sub-6 importance |

---

## Verification

After curation operations:

- [ ] Updated memories reflect accurate current state
- [ ] Obsolete memories have clear reason documented
- [ ] New links are bidirectional and meaningful
- [ ] No duplicate memories remain on the same topic
- [ ] Curation changes were confirmed by user before execution
