# Exploring the Knowledge Graph

Forgetful stores knowledge as an interconnected graph: memories link to other memories, entities link to memories, and entities relate to each other. Deep exploration reveals context that simple queries miss.

## Triggers

| Trigger Phrase | Operation |
|----------------|-----------|
| `what do you know about X` | Full knowledge graph traversal |
| `how do I explore the knowledge graph` | Graph exploration workflow |
| `how are these concepts connected` | Entity relationship traversal |
| `give me comprehensive context on X` | Deep multi-phase exploration |
| `map out related knowledge for X` | Entity discovery and memory linking |

---

## When to Explore

Explore the knowledge graph when:

- Starting complex work that spans multiple topics
- User asks "what do you know about X"
- Planning requires understanding existing decisions/patterns
- Investigating how concepts connect across projects
- Need comprehensive context, not just top search results

## Exploration Phases

Track visited IDs to prevent cycles. Execute phases sequentially.

### Phase 1: Semantic Entry Point

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("query_memory", {
  "query": "<topic>",
  "query_context": "Exploring knowledge graph for comprehensive context",
  "k": 5,
  "include_links": true,
  "max_links_per_primary": 5
})
```

Collect: `primary_memories` + `linked_memories` (1-hop connections).

### Phase 2: Expand Memory Details

For key memories, get full details:

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("get_memory", {"memory_id": <id>})
```

Extract: `document_ids`, `code_artifact_ids`, `project_ids`, additional `linked_memory_ids`.

### Phase 3: Entity Discovery

Find entities in discovered projects:

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("list_entities", {
  "project_ids": [<discovered project ids>]
})
```

### Phase 4: Entity Relationships

For relevant entities, map relationship graph:

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("get_entity_relationships", {
  "entity_id": <id>,
  "direction": "both"
})
```

Relationship types: works_for, owns, manages, collaborates_with, etc.

### Phase 5: Entity-Linked Memories

For each entity, find all linked memories:

```javascript
execute_forgetful_tool("get_entity_memories", {
  "entity_id": <id>
})
```

Returns `{"memory_ids": [...], "count": N}`. Fetch any new memories not already visited.

## Presenting Results

Group findings by type:

**Memories**: Primary (direct matches) → Linked (1-hop) → Entity-linked (via entities)

**Entities**: Name, type, relationship count, linked memory count

**Artifacts**: Documents and code snippets found via memory links

**Graph Summary**: Total nodes, key themes, suggested follow-up queries

## Depth Control

- **Shallow** (phases 1-2): Quick context, ~5-15 memories
- **Medium** (phases 1-4): Include entities and relationships
- **Deep** (all phases): Full graph traversal, comprehensive context

Match depth to task complexity. Start shallow, go deeper if context insufficient.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Starting complex work spanning multiple topics
- User asks "what do you know about X"
- Planning requires understanding existing decisions and patterns
- Investigating how concepts connect across projects

Use [using-forgetful-memory](../using-forgetful-memory/SKILL.md) instead when:

- Creating or querying individual memories
- Simple semantic search is sufficient

Use [curating-memories](../curating-memories/SKILL.md) instead when:

- Updating, obsoleting, or linking specific memories
- Cleaning up duplicate or stale content

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Running all 5 phases for simple queries | Wastes tokens on unnecessary traversal | Start shallow (phases 1-2), go deeper only if needed |
| Not tracking visited IDs | Causes infinite cycles in graph traversal | Maintain a visited set, skip already-seen nodes |
| Expanding every linked memory | Exponential blowup on dense graphs | Focus on high-importance memories (7+) |
| Skipping entity phases when entities exist | Misses cross-project connections | Check for entities in Phase 3 before skipping |
| Presenting raw results without grouping | Overwhelming and unstructured | Group by type: memories, entities, artifacts |

---

## Verification

After graph exploration:

- [ ] Entry point query returned relevant results
- [ ] No cycles encountered (visited IDs tracked)
- [ ] Depth matched task complexity (shallow/medium/deep)
- [ ] Results grouped by type for readability
- [ ] Follow-up queries identified if context was insufficient

---

## Efficiency Tips

- Check `truncated` flag from query_memory (8000 token budget)
- Skip Phase 3-5 if no entities exist in discovered projects
- Use `project_ids` filter to scope exploration
- Stop expanding when hitting diminishing returns
