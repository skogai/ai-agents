"""Shared path validation utilities for CWE-22 path traversal prevention.

Provides repo-root-anchored path validation that prevents:
- Symlink traversal (symlinks resolving outside repo)
- Absolute paths (e.g., /etc/passwd)
- Encoded traversal edge cases (e.g., ..%2F)
- Literal .. components that resolve outside repo

See: CWE-22 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
