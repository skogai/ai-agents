# Execution Plans Skill

Treat execution plans as first-class artifacts, versioned in the repository.

## Directory Structure

```text
.agents/
├── plans/
│   ├── active/        # Plans currently in progress
│   ├── completed/     # Successfully finished plans
│   └── abandoned/     # Plans that were stopped (with rationale)
└── debt/
    └── tech-debt-registry.md  # Known technical debt items
```

## Triggers

| Trigger Phrase | Operation |
|----------------|-----------|
| `create execution plan` | Create new plan in active/ |
| `update plan progress` | Add progress entry to existing plan |
| `log decision` | Add decision to plan's decision log |
| `complete plan` | Move plan to completed/ |
| `abandon plan` | Move plan to abandoned/ with rationale |

## Plan Template

Use `.agents/plans/TEMPLATE.md` as the starting point for new plans.

### Required Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Metadata | Status, dates, owner, complexity |
| Objectives | Checkboxes for trackable goals |
| Decision Log | Table of decisions with rationale |
| Progress Log | Timestamped updates with agent attribution |
| Blockers | Current impediments |
| Related | Links to issues, PRs, ADRs |

## Workflow

### Creating a Plan

1. Copy TEMPLATE.md to `.agents/plans/active/{slug}.md`
2. Fill metadata (status: In Progress, created: today, owner: agent name)
3. Define objectives as checkboxes
4. Link to related issue/PR

### Updating Progress

1. Check off completed objectives
2. Add entry to Progress Log table with date, update, and agent name
3. Update blockers if any emerge

### Logging Decisions

Add row to Decision Log table:

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | What was decided | Why this choice | What else was evaluated |

### Completing a Plan

1. Verify all objectives checked
2. Update status to Completed
3. Move file from `active/` to `completed/`
4. Add final progress entry

### Blocking a Plan

1. Update status to Blocked
2. Document impediment in Blockers section
3. Add progress entry noting the block

### Abandoning a Plan

1. Update status to Abandoned
2. Document rationale in blockers or final progress entry
3. Move file from `active/` to `abandoned/`

## Integration

- Session logs reference active plans when relevant
- Planner skill creates plans here when executing complex work
- Retrospectives link back to completed plans

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Plans without objectives | Not trackable | Define measurable checkboxes |
| Undocumented decisions | Lost institutional knowledge | Log every non-trivial choice |
| Stale active plans | Clutters workspace | Complete or abandon promptly |
| Plans without issue links | No traceability | Always link to source issue |

## Verification

After creating a plan:

- [ ] File in `.agents/plans/active/`
- [ ] Metadata section complete
- [ ] At least one objective defined
- [ ] Linked to issue or PR

After completing:

- [ ] All objectives checked
- [ ] Final progress entry added
- [ ] File moved to `completed/`
