"""Cluster unresolved PR review threads by shared gist before the fix loop.

Phase 0 of the pr-comment-responder workflow. When a bot rescan surfaces many
unresolved threads, several are often the same root cause stated on different
files. PR #1897 round 7 surfaced 17 unresolved threads; 8 were the same
"model_tier=opus contradicts cheaper-tier reviewer claim" framing on different
paths (see .agents/retrospective/2026-05-08-pr-1897-confident-incorrectness-recurrence.md).
Rounds 5 and 6 patched those per-file and did not close the cluster; round 7
retired the framing in the source artifact and the cluster collapsed in one
round.

This module turns the agent-side mental model captured in the global memory
``feedback_bot_thread_clustering.md`` ("4+ threads with the same gist = single
source-of-truth violation, retire the framing once") into a mechanical step.
When a cluster reaches ``CLUSTER_WARNING_THRESHOLD`` threads it is flagged so the
agent fixes the framing root cause before the per-thread fix loop begins.

Pipeline:

1. Fetch unresolved threads with a clustering-specific GraphQL query that
   selects path and first-comment body fields, then map nodes through
   ``github_core.review_threads.transform_review_thread``.
2. Extract a "gist" (a set of load-bearing tokens) from each thread's first
   comment body.
3. Cluster threads whose gists overlap (Jaccard similarity at or above
   ``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD``) using union-find.
4. Report clusters of ``CLUSTER_WARNING_THRESHOLD`` or more threads, naming the
   source artifact (the file path shared by the most threads in the cluster)
   most likely to be the framing root cause.

The fetch is an integration point; the clustering is pure. ``cluster_threads``
and its helpers take plain dicts (the canonical flat thread shape produced by
``github_core.review_threads.transform_review_thread``) and return plain dicts,
so the algorithm is unit-testable without the network.

Exit codes follow ADR-035:
    0 - Report produced (warnings, if any, are in the JSON; not an error exit)
    2 - Config/usage error (invalid parameters)
    3 - Fetch failed (could not obtain a trustworthy thread snapshot)
    4 - Auth error
