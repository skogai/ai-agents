# PR Comment Responder

Coordinates PR review responses through context gathering, comment tracking, and orchestrator delegation.

## Triggers

| Phrase | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `respond to PR comments` | Full workflow |
| `address review feedback on PR #123` | Full workflow |
| `handle PR review comments` | Full workflow |
| `fix PR review issues` | Full workflow |
| `reply to reviewer on PR #123` | Target specific PR |

## Quick Reference

### Context Inference (Phase -1)

**ALWAYS extract PR context from prompt first. Never prompt for information already provided.**

```bash
SCRIPTS_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.claude}/skills/github/scripts"

# Extract PR number and owner/repo from user prompt
python3 "$SCRIPTS_DIR/utils/extract_github_context.py" --text "[prompt]" --require-pr
```

Supported patterns:

- Text: `PR 806`, `PR #806`, `pull request 123`, `#806`
- URLs: `github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`

See [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md) Phase -1 for full details.

### Tools

| Operation | Script |
|-----------|--------|
| **Context extraction** | `extract_github_context.py` |
| PR metadata | `get_pr_context.py` |
| Comments | `get_pr_review_comments.py --include-issue-comments` |
| Domain classification | `get_pr_review_comments.py --group-by-domain` |
| Reviewers | `get_pr_reviewers.py` |
| Reply | `post_pr_comment_reply.py` |
| Reaction | `add_comment_reaction.py` |
| Resolve thread | `resolve_pr_review_thread.py` |

### Reviewer Priority

| Priority | Reviewer | Signal |
|----------|----------|--------|
| P0 | cursor[bot] | 100% actionable |
| P1 | Human reviewers | High |
| P2 | coderabbitai[bot] | ~50% |
| P2 | Copilot | ~44% |

### Domain-Based Priority

Comments are classified into domains for priority-based triage:

| Priority | Domain | Keywords | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| P0 | Security | CWE-*, vulnerability, injection, XSS, SQL, CSRF, auth, secrets, credentials, TOCTOU, symlink, traversal | Process FIRST - security-critical issues |
| P1 | Bug | error, crash, exception, fail, null, undefined, race condition, deadlock, memory leak | Address functional issues |
| P2 | Style | formatting, naming, indentation, whitespace, convention, prefer, consider, suggest | Apply improvements when time permits |
| P3 | Summary | Bot-generated summaries (## Summary, ### Overview) | Informational only |

**Domain-First Processing Workflow:**

```bash
SCRIPTS_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.claude}/skills/github/scripts"

# Get comments grouped by domain
comments=$(python3 "$SCRIPTS_DIR/pr/get_pr_review_comments.py" --pull-request 908 --group-by-domain --include-issue-comments)

# Process security FIRST (CWE, vulnerabilities, injection)
echo "$comments" | jq -r '.Security[]' | while read -r comment; do
    # Handle security-critical issues immediately
    # Route to security agent if needed
    echo "Processing security comment"
done

# Then bugs (errors, crashes, null references)
echo "$comments" | jq -r '.Bug[]' | while read -r comment; do
    # Address functional issues
    echo "Processing bug comment"
done

# Then style (formatting, naming, conventions)
echo "$comments" | jq -r '.Style[]' | while read -r comment; do
    # Apply style improvements
    echo "Processing style comment"
done

# Finally general comments (everything else)
echo "$comments" | jq -r '.General[]' | while read -r comment; do
    # Process general feedback
    echo "Processing general comment"
done

# Skip summary comments (bot-generated noise)
# .Summary contains informational summaries only
```

**Benefits:**

- Security issues processed before style suggestions
- Reduces noise from bot-generated summaries
- Enables metrics tracking (security vs style comment distribution)

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- A PR has unaddressed review comments from humans or bots
- You need to systematically triage and respond to all review feedback
- CI review bots (CodeRabbit, Copilot, cursor) left comments requiring action

Use direct `post_pr_comment_reply.py` instead when:

- Replying to a single known comment (no triage needed)
- You already know the exact response to post

## Process

### Phase 1: Context and Gather

1. Extract PR number from prompt (BLOCKING) using `extract_github_context.py`
2. Load `pr-comment-responder-skills` memory
3. Gather PR metadata, reviewers, all comments (use `--group-by-domain` for priority triage)
4. Batch eyes reactions on all comments

### Phase 2: Triage and Delegate

1. Generate comment map: `.agents/pr-comments/PR-[N]/comments.md`
2. Delegate each comment to orchestrator (process security domain first)
3. Implement changes via orchestrator delegation

### Phase 3: Verify

1. All comments resolved (COMPLETE or WONTFIX)
2. No new comments after 45s wait
3. CI checks passing, all threads resolved, commits pushed

See [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md) for full phase details.

## Verification

- [ ] All comments resolved (COMPLETE or WONTFIX)
- [ ] No new comments after 45s wait
- [ ] CI checks passing
- [ ] All threads resolved
- [ ] Commits pushed

See [references/gates.md](references/gates.md) for gate implementation.

### Response Templates

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for:

- Won't Fix responses
- Clarification requests
- Resolution replies

### Bot Handling

See [references/bots.md](references/bots.md) for:

- Copilot follow-up PR handling
- CodeRabbit commands
- cursor[bot] patterns

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Replying to bot summaries as actionable comments | Wastes time on informational noise | Skip Summary domain comments |
| Processing style before security | Misses critical issues | Process domains in P0-P3 priority order |
| Using raw `gh` commands | Bypasses tested skill scripts | Use `post_pr_comment_reply.py` and other skill scripts |
| Prompting user for PR number already in prompt | Redundant and frustrating | Use `extract_github_context.py` to parse from input |

## Extension Points

- Add new domain classifiers in `get_pr_review_comments.py --group-by-domain`
- Add reviewer priority entries for new bot integrations
- Add response templates in `references/templates.md`
