# Response Templates

## Reply Guidelines

**DO mention reviewer when**:

- You have a question that needs their answer
- You need clarification to proceed
- The comment requires their decision

**DO NOT mention reviewer when**:

- Acknowledging receipt (use reaction instead)
- Providing a final resolution (commit hash)
- The response is informational only

**Why this matters**:

- Mentioning @copilot triggers a new PR analysis (costs premium requests)
- Mentioning @coderabbitai triggers re-review
- Unnecessary mentions create noise and cleanup work

## Reply API Usage

**CRITICAL**: Never use the issue comments API (`/issues/{number}/comments`) to reply to review comments. This places replies out of context as top-level PR comments instead of in-thread.

```bash
SCRIPTS_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.claude}/skills/github/scripts"

# In-thread reply (CORRECT)
python3 "$SCRIPTS_DIR/pr/post_pr_comment_reply.py" --pull-request [number] --comment-id [id] --body "[response]"

# For multi-line responses, stage the body in a TEMP file ($TMPDIR or /tmp).
# Do NOT write reply drafts under .agents/, the repo working tree, or any
# path that survives the session. Reply drafts have no enduring value once
# posted; staging them under .agents/audit/pr-*-replies/ creates untracked
# workspace clutter that future agents cannot tell apart from artifacts the
# PR intentionally archived. Using a temp dir prevents the clutter from
# being written in the first place; .gitignore is only a safety net that
# keeps any stray drafts out of git history.
REPLY_FILE="$(mktemp -t pr-reply-XXXXXX.md)"
trap 'rm -f "$REPLY_FILE"' EXIT
cat > "$REPLY_FILE" <<'EOF'
[response body]
EOF
python3 "$SCRIPTS_DIR/pr/post_pr_comment_reply.py" --pull-request [number] --comment-id [id] --body-file "$REPLY_FILE"

# Top-level PR comment (no comment-id)
python3 "$SCRIPTS_DIR/pr/post_pr_comment_reply.py" --pull-request [number] --body "[response]"
```
