# CVA Analysis - Discover Natural Abstractions

Commonality Variability Analysis (CVA) is a systematic technique for discovering abstractions from requirements. Instead of choosing patterns first, you build a matrix showing what's COMMON (constant across use cases) vs what VARIES (differs between cases). Patterns emerge naturally from the matrix structure.

**Core Insight**: Rows (commonalities) map to Strategy pattern. Columns (variabilities) map to Abstract Factory pattern. The matrix reveals whether abstraction is needed at all.

**From CLAUDE.md Design Philosophy**: "Greatest vulnerability is wrong or missing abstraction." CVA prevents wrong abstractions by making pattern selection evidence-based, not intuition-based.

## Triggers

Activate CVA when you encounter:

- `discover abstractions for [domain]`
- `run CVA analysis on [requirements]`
- `commonality variability analysis`
- `prevent wrong abstraction`
- `what patterns emerge from [use cases]`

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Purpose | Input | Output | Time |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Identify Commonalities | Find what's constant across ALL use cases | Use cases/requirements | List of commonalities (matrix rows) | 5-10 min |
| 2. Identify Variabilities | Find what VARIES between use cases | Commonalities + use cases | List of variabilities (matrix columns) | 5-10 min |
| 3. Build Matrix | Visualize commonality × variability relationships | Rows + columns | CVA matrix (Markdown table) | 5-15 min |
| 4. Map to Patterns | Translate matrix structure to design patterns | Completed matrix | Pattern recommendations + rationale | 5-10 min |
| 5. Validate & Handoff | Validate choices, route to appropriate agents | Pattern recommendations | Validation report + ADR stub | 5-10 min |

**Total Time**: Quick (15 min), Standard (30 min), Deep (60 min)

## When to Use

**Use CVA when:**

- Facing 2+ similar but varying requirements
- About to select a design pattern (validate with CVA first)
- Refactoring code with duplicated logic
- Need evidence for abstraction decisions (ADR material)
- Team debates whether to abstract (make implicit explicit)

**Do NOT use CVA when:**

- Only 1 use case exists (wait for 2nd per YAGNI)
- Pattern is obvious and uncontested (don't over-analyze)
- Time-critical decision (<15 min available, use intuition)
- Requirements are still highly uncertain (premature)

## Process

### Phase 1: Identify Commonalities

**Purpose**: Establish what is ALWAYS true across ALL use cases. This becomes the stable foundation.

**Steps**:

1. **Start with first use case**: What does it need? List all capabilities.
2. **Add second use case**: What do BOTH need? Extract shared capabilities.
3. **For each additional use case**: What do ALL cases need?
4. **Document as matrix ROWS**: Each row is a commonality present in every use case.

**Example** (Payment Processing):

```text
Use Case 1: Credit card payment
Use Case 2: PayPal payment
Use Case 3: Bank transfer

Commonalities (ALL cases need):
- Validate payment amount
- Authorize transaction
- Record transaction
- Handle transaction errors
```

**Verification**:

- [ ] Each commonality appears in ALL use cases
- [ ] At least 2 commonalities identified (if only 1, reconsider scope)
- [ ] Commonalities are capabilities/behaviors, not implementation details

**Failure Handling**: If no commonalities exist, use cases may be unrelated. Analyze separately or reconsider grouping.

---

### Phase 2: Identify Variabilities

**Purpose**: Discover what VARIES between use cases. This reveals extension points where Strategy or Abstract Factory patterns may apply.

**Steps**:

1. **For each commonality, ask**: "How does this vary across cases?"
2. **List variations**: Document different implementations for each commonality.
3. **Document as matrix COLUMNS**: Each column is a variation.
4. **Optional**: Add "Future Variations" column for anticipated changes.

**Example** (continuing Payment Processing):

```text
Commonality: Validate payment amount

Variations:
- Credit Card: Check card limit, validate CVV
- PayPal: Check PayPal balance, validate account status
- Bank Transfer: Check account balance, validate routing number

Commonality: Authorize transaction

Variations:
- Credit Card: Contact card issuer API
- PayPal: OAuth flow with PayPal
- Bank Transfer: ACH authorization
```

**Verification**:

- [ ] Each variability differs in at least 2 use cases
- [ ] Variations are concrete implementations, not abstract
- [ ] If ZERO variability (all cells identical), abstraction may not be needed

**Failure Handling**: If all variability (no commonality), design may be too broad. Narrow scope or reconsider.

---

### Phase 3: Build CVA Matrix

**Purpose**: Create visual artifact showing commonality × variability relationships. Makes implicit design explicit for team discussion.

**Steps**:

1. **Create Markdown table**: Commonalities as rows, variabilities as columns
2. **Fill each cell**: Concrete implementation for that commonality/variability pair
3. **Highlight patterns**: Where cells are identical (sharing opportunity), where they differ (extension point)
4. **Optional**: Export to Mermaid diagram using `scripts/export-cva-matrix.py`

**Example Matrix**:

| Commonality | Credit Card | PayPal | Bank Transfer |
|-------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Validate amount | Check card limit, CVV | Check PayPal balance, account | Check account balance, routing |
| Authorize | Card issuer API | PayPal OAuth | ACH authorization |
| Record | Log to CardTransactionDB | Log to PayPalTransactionDB | Log to BankTransactionDB |
| Handle errors | Card decline codes | PayPal error codes | ACH rejection codes |

**Interpretation**:

- **Row perspective (Strategy pattern)**: "Authorize" varies across payment methods → Strategy pattern for authorization
- **Column perspective (Abstract Factory pattern)**: Each payment method has consistent set of operations → Abstract Factory for payment providers
- **Cell perspective**: "Log to *TransactionDB" shows common pattern with variation → Template Method or Strategy

**Verification**:

- [ ] Matrix is at least 2×2 (minimum for pattern discovery)
- [ ] All cells are filled (no empty cells)
- [ ] Patterns becoming visible (some cells identical, some divergent)

**Failure Handling**: If matrix shows no useful patterns, abstraction may not be beneficial. Document rationale for concrete implementation.

---

### Phase 4: Map to Patterns

**Purpose**: Translate matrix structure to design patterns. Patterns EMERGE from analysis, not imposed.

**Steps**:

1. **Read ROWS (commonalities)**:
   - If each row has different implementations across columns → **Strategy pattern** (vary algorithm for same operation)
   - Example: "Authorize" row has 3 implementations → `IAuthorizationStrategy`

2. **Read COLUMNS (variabilities)**:
   - If each column represents a coherent family of implementations → **Abstract Factory pattern** (vary implementations across product families)
   - Example: "Credit Card" column has consistent set of card-specific operations → `CreditCardPaymentFactory`

3. **Check for multidimensional variability**:
   - If BOTH rows AND columns vary independently → Combination patterns or reconsider scope
   - Start with dominant axis (more variance), note multidimensional case in Extension Points

4. **Document recommendations**:
   - Which pattern(s) fit?
   - WHY do they fit? (cite matrix structure)
   - What are alternatives? (if any)

**Example Output**:

```markdown
## Pattern Recommendations

### Primary: Abstract Factory Pattern

**Rationale**: Each payment method (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer) requires a coherent family of related operations. Matrix columns show consistent product families.

**Implementation**:
```csharp
public interface IPaymentFactory {
    IAmountValidator CreateValidator();
    ITransactionAuthorizer CreateAuthorizer();
    ITransactionRecorder CreateRecorder();
    IErrorHandler CreateErrorHandler();
}

public class CreditCardPaymentFactory : IPaymentFactory {
    // Concrete implementations from "Credit Card" column
}
```

**Alternative**: Strategy pattern per row (4 separate strategies). Rejected because operations are not independent - they share payment method context. Factory keeps cohesion.

```

**Create ADR stub** for architect agent:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Payment Processing Abstraction

## Context
CVA matrix revealed 3 payment methods with 4 common operations, each varying by method.

## Decision
Use Abstract Factory pattern with `IPaymentFactory` per method.

## Rationale
- Matrix columns show coherent product families
- Operations share payment method context (not independent)
- New payment methods extend without modifying existing

## Alternatives Considered
- Strategy per operation: Rejected (operations not independent, loses cohesion)
- No abstraction: Rejected (3 methods with clear variations justify abstraction per YAGNI threshold)
```

**Verification**:

- [ ] Recommended patterns align with matrix structure
- [ ] Rationale explains WHY patterns fit (cites matrix evidence)
- [ ] Edge cases addressed (single use case → don't abstract, all variability → reconsider)
- [ ] ADR stub created with decision rationale

**Failure Handling**: If no patterns fit cleanly, document rationale for concrete implementation. Abstraction may not be warranted yet.

---

### Phase 5: Validation and Handoff

**Purpose**: Validate abstraction choices and route to appropriate agents for review.

**Steps**:

1. **Run validation script**:

   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/cva-analysis/scripts/validate-cva-matrix.py cva-matrix.md
   ```

   - Checks: ≥2 rows, ≥2 columns, all cells filled, patterns suggested
   - Exit code 0 = pass, 10 = validation failure, 1 = error

2. **Route to decision-critic** (if abstraction recommended):

   ```bash
   # Use decision-critic skill to validate abstraction choice
   /decision-critic "Validate Abstract Factory pattern for payment processing per CVA analysis"
   ```

3. **Route to architect agent** (for ADR creation):

   ```bash
   # Hand off ADR stub to architect agent
   Task(subagent_type="architect", prompt="Create ADR from CVA analysis stub")
   ```

4. **Document reassessment triggers**:

   ```markdown
   ## Reassessment Triggers

   Re-run CVA when:
   - 3+ new payment methods added
   - Major architectural shift (e.g., microservices split)
   - Performance issues with current abstraction
   - Team feedback: abstraction is too complex or not pulling weight
   ```

**Outputs**:

- Validation report (pass/fail with specific issues)
- Handoff to decision-critic and/or architect agent
- Reassessment triggers documented

**Verification**:

- [ ] Validation script exits with code 0
- [ ] Decision-critic review completed (if abstraction recommended)
- [ ] Reassessment triggers are specific, not vague

**Failure Handling**: If validation fails, return to earlier phase based on issue:

- Missing commonalities → Phase 1
- Incomplete matrix → Phase 3
- Pattern mismatch → Phase 4

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Example | Instead |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Pattern-First Design** | Violates CVA principle: patterns emerge, not imposed. Leads to wrong abstractions. | Decide "we need Strategy pattern" BEFORE running CVA | Run CVA first. Let matrix reveal pattern. If no pattern emerges, abstraction may not be needed. |
| **Forcing Abstractions** | Creates complexity without benefit. Worse than no abstraction per CLAUDE.md. | CVA shows no variability, but create Strategy anyway "for future" | When CVA shows no variability, explicitly document decision NOT to abstract. Revisit when variability emerges. |
| **Skipping Matrix Visualization** | Loses pedagogical and collaborative benefits. Matrix makes assumptions explicit. | Identify commonalities/variabilities mentally, skip matrix, jump to pattern | Always create visual matrix (Markdown table minimum). Use for team review, ADR rationale. |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | CVA is a tool, not an end. Over-analysis wastes time. | Spend 3 hours on CVA for 2 simple use cases | Use tiered approach: Quick (15 min) for simple, Standard (30 min) moderate, Deep (60 min) architectural. Set timer. |
| **Ignoring Temporal Dimension** | Today's constant may be tomorrow's variable. | CVA assumes "currency" constant (USD only). 6 months later, need multi-currency. | Include "Future Variations" column for anticipated changes. Balance YAGNI with known roadmap. |
| **Using CVA for Single Use Case** | CVA requires 2+ cases to identify commonality/variability. | Run CVA on payment before any other transaction exists | Wait for 2nd use case (YAGNI), OR document anticipated cases with stakeholder validation. |

## Integration with Other Skills

### architect Agent

CVA produces ADR stub with pattern rationale. Architect agent creates formal ADR.

**Handoff Protocol**:

```python
Task(subagent_type="architect", prompt="Create ADR from CVA analysis at cva-payment-processing.md")
```

### decision-critic Skill

Validates abstraction choices discovered via CVA. Applies inversion thinking to pattern recommendation.

**Usage**:

```bash
/decision-critic "Validate Abstract Factory pattern for payment processing per CVA matrix"
```

### independent-thinker Agent

Challenges whether abstraction is needed at all. Use when CVA is borderline (minimal variability).

**Usage**:

```python
Task(subagent_type="independent-thinker", prompt="Challenge whether payment abstraction is justified given only 2 current methods")
```

## Verification Checklist

After completing CVA:

- [ ] Matrix has ≥2 rows (commonalities) and ≥2 columns (variabilities)
- [ ] All matrix cells are filled with concrete implementations
- [ ] Recommended patterns align with matrix structure (rows → Strategy, columns → Factory)
- [ ] Rationale explains WHY patterns fit (cites matrix as evidence)
- [ ] Edge cases handled (single use case, all variability, no commonality)
- [ ] Validation script passes: `python3 scripts/validate-cva-matrix.py [file]`
- [ ] ADR stub created with decision rationale
- [ ] Reassessment triggers documented (when to re-run CVA)

## Reassessment Triggers

Re-run CVA when:

1. **3+ new use cases** added (may reveal new patterns or invalidate current abstraction)
2. **Major architectural shift** (e.g., monolith → microservices)
3. **Performance issues** with current abstraction (overhead not justified)
4. **Team feedback**: Abstraction is too complex, not pulling weight, or forcing designs
5. **Quarterly review** (align with retrospective cycle)

## Tiered Depth Levels

Choose depth based on decision impact:

| Tier | Time | Use Cases | When to Use |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Quick | 15 min | 2-3 | Simple decisions, clear patterns, low risk |
| Standard | 30 min | 3-5 | Moderate complexity, some uncertainty, medium risk |
| Deep | 60 min | 6+ | Architectural decisions, high uncertainty, high risk |

**Time-boxing**: Set timer, commit to best-available analysis when time expires. CVA is a tool, not a perfectionist exercise.
