"""In-process hook dispatcher for Copilot CLI (ADR-068, addresses #2295).

Copilot CLI has no per-hook ``matcher`` support, so it runs every registered
hook entry on every tool call. With one process per matcher shim, the aggregate
Python interpreter cold-start (~200 ms each, ~40 shims) exceeds Copilot's
``preToolUse`` timeout budget and a healthy hook gets killed, denying benign
tools (false fail-closed).

This dispatcher collapses N per-shim processes into one. The host spawns a
single interpreter per event; each shim then runs *in process* via ``runpy``,
so the interpreter cold-start is paid once instead of N times.

Design contract (the security-critical part):

- **Manifest-driven, not directory-driven.** The shim list is supplied by the
  caller from the generator's registered-entry list (the same source as
  ``hooks.json``). Orphaned ``invoke_*.py`` files on disk are never executed.
- **Gate vs observe mode (ADR-068, #2342).** ``run_dispatch`` takes a
  ``short_circuit`` flag. In gate mode (``PreToolUse``) the first shim that exits
  non-zero denies the tool; the dispatcher returns that code and stops
  (fail-closed, ADR-066). A registered shim missing on disk, or an unexpected
  exception while running a shim, is a denial (exit 2), never a silent allow. A
  shim's own internal fail-open (its ``main`` returning 0 on its own error) is
  preserved, because the dispatcher only observes the shim's final exit code.
  Per-shim timeout metadata is validated, but not enforced with daemon threads:
  a timed-out Python thread cannot be killed and can leave child processes
  running after hook success. The host owns the cumulative event timeout and
  kills the whole dispatcher process if that budget is exhausted. In observe
  mode (``PostToolUse``, ``SessionStart``, ``SessionEnd``,
  ``UserPromptSubmit``) every shim runs regardless of an earlier non-zero exit;
  failures are logged and the dispatcher returns 0, matching the old host
  behavior where the host ran all observer entries before consolidation.
- **stdin replay.** Each shim reads ``sys.stdin.buffer``; the dispatcher rewinds
  a fresh stream of the original bytes before each shim, so every shim inspects
  exactly the payload the host delivered (no #2290 schema mutation).
- **Output passthrough.** Shim stdout/stderr flows to the dispatcher's streams,
  so block guidance still reaches the host.
