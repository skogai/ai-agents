"""Shared framework for pre-push guard hooks.

Provides one public entry point: :func:`run_guard`. Hooks call it with a
validator function, the path globs that activate them, and a short name
used in log lines and error codes. The framework owns:

- bootstrap of ``hook_utilities``
- consumer-repo skip
- stdin parsing (with size cap)
- ``git diff --name-only @{push}..HEAD`` with a fallback chain that
  prefers the per-branch upstream (``@{u}``) and only falls through to
  ``refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`` (typically ``origin/main``) when no
  upstream is set; ``origin/main`` is the literal last resort. See
  ``_detect_default_base_ref`` for the rationale.
- glob filtering (single-segment via fnmatch, multi-segment via prefix
  plus suffix string check; see issue 1884 pre-mortem R-E)
- structured stdout block on violation
- a machine-parseable ``EVENT=<json>`` line on stderr for every block
- fail-open on infrastructure errors

Hook Type: PreToolUse

Exit Codes (Claude Hook Semantics, exempt from ADR-035):
    0 = Allow (no matching files, validator clean, infra fallback)
    2 = Block (validator returned violations OR bootstrap failed)

Bootstrap failures (missing plugin lib) exit 2, NOT fail-open. A guard
that cannot find its lib is a hard misconfiguration; allowing pushes
silently in that state would defeat the framework. This is the only
non-fail-open path.

Naming convention:
    The ``name`` argument becomes ``E_<NAME_UPPER>`` in the error code,
    with hyphens converted to underscores. Examples:
        name="markdown-lint"  -> E_MARKDOWN_LINT
        name="manifest-count" -> E_MANIFEST_COUNT
        name="session-log"    -> E_SESSION_LOG

When NOT to use this framework:
    - PostToolUse hooks (different hook semantics).
    - Hooks that do not consult ``git diff`` (this framework is push-time
      specific).
    - Hooks that need different exit code semantics (e.g., must always
      block on infrastructure errors). Those should compose differently
      or stay self-contained.

Operations and telemetry:
    Every block emits ``EVENT={...}`` to stderr with a fixed schema
    (``guard``, ``code``, ``outcome="block"``, ``violations``,
    ``matched_files``, ``changed_files``). Every fail-open path also emits
    ``EVENT={...}`` with ``outcome="fail_open"`` plus a ``reason`` and a
    free-form ``detail``. A telemetry pipeline that greps for ``^EVENT=``
    sees both classes of events; ratios of fail-opens to blocks are the
    primary signal that a guard is degraded. See PR #1887 and issue #1884
    for the behavior contract; a dedicated runbook is tracked as a
    follow-up.
