## Fastest Start

Each AI tool has its own plugin install flow. Pick yours and paste the command(s) inside the CLI session.

**Claude Code.** One command installs the full set; restart Claude Code when it finishes.

```text
/install-plugin rjmurillo/ai-agents
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI.** Two steps: register the marketplace, then install the toolkit. No restart needed afterward; Copilot CLI picks agents up automatically.

```text
/plugin marketplace add rjmurillo/ai-agents
/plugin install project-toolkit@ai-agents
```

Either path lands you with 23 agents, 70 skills, and 58 ADRs. See [Verify Installation](#verify-installation) for the per-tool sanity check, or [More Installation Options](#alternative-full-installation) for component-level installs and a TUI alternative.

### What You Get

| Component | Count | What it does |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Agents | 23 | Specialized roles: analyst, architect, implementer, QA, security, and more |
| Skills | 70 | Reusable workflows: git, PR management, testing, linting, session protocol |
| Commands | 17+ | Slash commands for lifecycle phases: /spec, /plan, /build, /test, /review, /ship |
| ADRs | 58 | Architectural Decision Records that steer agent behavior |
| Session protocol | 1 | Structured session logs with commit gates and evidence tracking |
| Review gates | 5 | Pre-PR validation across architecture, security, quality, tests, standards |

### Troubleshooting

- **`/install-plugin` not recognized:** That command is Claude Code only. In Copilot CLI use the two-step flow (`/plugin marketplace add rjmurillo/ai-agents` then `/plugin install project-toolkit@ai-agents`).
- **Copilot CLI install fails with "No plugin.json found in repository":** This repo is a marketplace, not a single plugin. Run `/plugin marketplace add rjmurillo/ai-agents` first, then `/plugin install project-toolkit@ai-agents`.
- **`/plugin` not recognized in Copilot CLI:** Update Copilot CLI to a recent stable release; plugin support is required. Run `copilot --version` in a regular terminal to check.
- **Plugin install fails or hangs:** Confirm your AI tool is on a recent stable release that supports the install command, then retry. Check the version per tool: in Claude Code use `/version` or the title bar; for Copilot CLI run `copilot --version` in a regular terminal.
- **Agents not responding after install:** Restart Claude Code (Copilot CLI does not need a restart). Then verify with `Task(subagent_type="analyst", prompt="Hello, are you available?")` in Claude Code, `copilot --list-agents` in Copilot CLI, or `@orchestrator Hello, are you available?` in VS Code Copilot Chat.

## Purpose and Scope

### What is AI Agents?

AI Agents is a coordinated multi-agent system for software development. It provides specialized AI agents that handle different phases of the development lifecycle, from research and planning through implementation and quality assurance.

The orchestrator is the hub of operations. Within it has logic from taking everything from a "vibe" or a "shower thought" and building out a fully functional spec with acceptance criteria and user stories, to taking a well defined idea as input and executing on it. There are 21 agents that cover the roles of software development, from vision and strategy, to architecture, implementation, and verification. Each role looks at something specific, like the critic that just looks to poke holes in other agents' (or your own) work, or DevOps that's concerned about how you deploy and operate the thing you just built.

The agents themselves use the platform specific handoffs to invoke subagents, keeping the orchestrator context clean. A great example of this is orchestrator facilitating creating and debating an [Architectural Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/) from research and drafting, to discussion, iterating on the issues, tie breaking when agents don't agree. And then  extracting persistent knowledge to steer future agents to adhere. Artifacts are stored in your memory system if you have one enabled, and Markdown files for easy reference to both agents and humans.

### Core Capabilities

- **21 specialized agents** for different development phases (analysis, architecture, implementation, QA, etc.)
- **Explicit handoff protocols** between agents with clear accountability
- **Multi-Agent Impact Analysis Framework** for comprehensive planning
- **Cross-session memory** with citation verification, graph traversal, and health reporting via Serena + Forgetful
- **Self-improvement system** with skill tracking and retrospectives
- **Quality gates** with pre-PR validation, session protocol enforcement, and automated CI checks
- **50+ reusable skills** for common development workflows (git, PR management, testing, linting)
- **TUI-based installation** via [skill-installer](https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer)
- **AI-powered CI/CD** with issue triage, PR quality gates, and spec validation

### Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Agent** | A specialized AI persona with a defined role (analyst, implementer, security, etc.) |
| **Orchestrator** | The coordinating agent that routes tasks to specialists and synthesizes results |
| **Handoff** | Explicit transfer of context and control between agents with clear accountability |
| **Skill** | A reusable workflow component for common tasks (50+ included: git, PR, testing, linting) |
| **Memory** | Cross-session context persistence via Serena + Forgetful for knowledge retention |
| **ADR** | Architectural Decision Record—structured documents capturing design decisions |
| **Quality Gate** | Validation checkpoint (critic review, QA pass, security scan) before proceeding |

## Alternative: Full Installation

The [Fastest Start](#fastest-start) above is the recommended path. Use the methods below when you want component-level control (agents only, toolkit only) or a TUI-driven installer.

> **Requirements:** Python 3.10+ and [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (for the skill-installer TUI only). The native plugin commands (`/install-plugin` in Claude Code, `/plugin install` in Copilot CLI) have no extra prerequisites.
>
> See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites) for full development setup including Python 3.14.x, pre-commit hooks, and test dependencies.

### Quick Install (CLI marketplace)

The [Fastest Start](#fastest-start) commands above install the full toolkit. For component-level installs, use the commands below from inside your AI coding tool. The `/plugin install <component>@ai-agents` form works in both tools, but in Copilot CLI you must register the marketplace first with `/plugin marketplace add rjmurillo/ai-agents` (Claude Code's `/install-plugin` registers and installs in one step).

| Component | Install Command | What You Get |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Claude agents only | `/plugin install claude-agents@ai-agents` | 24 specialized agents for Claude Code |
| Copilot CLI agents only | `/plugin install copilot-cli-agents@ai-agents` | 24 agent definitions for Copilot CLI |
| Full project toolkit | `/plugin install project-toolkit@ai-agents` | 23 agents, 17+ commands, 29 hooks, 70 skills (Claude Code only) |

### Verify Installation

After installing, confirm the agents are loaded.

**Claude Code:**

```text
Task(subagent_type="analyst", prompt="Hello, are you available?")
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI:**

```bash
copilot --list-agents
```

**VS Code (Copilot Chat):**

```text
@orchestrator Hello, are you available?
```

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Agent Location | Usage |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Claude Code CLI** | `src/claude/` | Use `Task(subagent_type="...")` |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `src/copilot-cli/` | Use `--agent` flag, `/agent` to select, or call out agent by name |
| **VS Code / GitHub Copilot** | `src/vs-code-agents/` | Use `@agent` syntax in Copilot Chat |

### Install via skill-installer

For a TUI-based interactive installation experience, use [skill-installer](https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer).

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+ and [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager.

```bash
# Run without installing (one-liner)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer skill-installer interactive

# Or install globally for repeated use
uv tool install git+https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer
skill-installer interactive
```

Navigate the TUI to browse and install agents for your platform.

See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for complete installation documentation, including UV setup, platform-specific paths, troubleshooting, and post-installation steps.

---

## Quick Start

After installing the agents with the method of your choice, you can either select one of them explicitly, ask your LLM to use the agent by name, or even prefix your input with the name of the agent.

### Examples

Here are prompts you can copy and paste. Prefix with the agent name to route directly, or use the orchestrator for multi-step workflows.

#### Simple Scenarios

Review code quality:

> critic: review @src/auth/login-handler.ts for coupling, error handling gaps, and test coverage. Deliver an APPROVE or REJECT verdict with specific line references.

Shows the critic agent doing a focused code review.

Investigate a bug:

> analyst: the /api/users endpoint returns 500 when the email contains a plus sign. Trace the request through the handler, identify the root cause, and propose a fix.

Shows the analyst doing root cause analysis on a specific bug.

Scan for vulnerabilities:

> security: scan @src/api/ for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Focus on injection, broken auth, and data exposure. Output a threat matrix with CWE identifiers and severity ratings.

Shows the security agent doing a targeted scan.

Write tests for existing code:

> qa: write pytest tests for @scripts/validate_session_json.py. Cover happy path, malformed input, missing required fields, and boundary conditions. Target 95% line coverage.

Shows the QA agent generating tests with specific coverage targets.

Document a module:

> explainer: document @scripts/memory_enhancement/ as a user guide. Include purpose, installation, CLI usage with examples, and architecture overview. Write for developers who have never seen this codebase.

Shows the explainer creating developer documentation.

Plan a feature:

> milestone-planner: break down "add webhook retry with exponential backoff" into milestones. Include acceptance criteria, estimated complexity, dependencies, and a suggested implementation order.

Shows the planner creating structured work packages.

#### Advanced Scenarios

End-to-end feature pipeline:

> orchestrator: build the webhook retry system described in @.agents/specs/webhook-retry.md. Start with analyst to verify requirements. Then milestone-planner to create work packages. Run critic to stress-test the plan. Then implementer to write code and tests. Run qa to verify coverage meets acceptance criteria. Run security to scan for injection and replay risks. Fix all critical findings recursively until critic, qa, and security pass. Open a PR.

The orchestrator chains seven agents into a full development pipeline with quality gates at each stage.

Architecture review:

> orchestrator: conduct a full review of @docs/architecture/service-mesh.md. Route through analyst for data accuracy, architect for structural decisions, security for threat modeling with CWE/CVSS ratings, critic to stress-test for gaps, and independent-thinker to challenge assumptions. Synthesize all findings into a single summary highlighting consensus and disagreements.

Five agents examine the same artifact through different lenses. The orchestrator synthesizes their independent assessments.

Debug, fix, and ship:

> orchestrator: the payment webhook handler drops events when Redis is unavailable. Have analyst investigate the failure pattern in the logs. Then architect propose a resilient design with fallback queuing. Then implementer build the fix with tests. Run qa and security to validate. Open a PR when all checks pass.

Turns an incident report into a shipped fix through structured agent collaboration.

Technology migration evaluation:

> orchestrator: we are considering migrating from REST to gRPC for internal services. Route through analyst to research benchmarks and ecosystem maturity. Then architect to map impact on existing contracts. Then security to threat-model the new transport layer. Then devops to estimate CI/CD changes. Then independent-thinker to argue the strongest case for staying with REST. Then high-level-advisor to deliver a GO or NO-GO verdict with conditions.

Six agents build a decision package. Each contributes a different dimension of analysis. The advisor synthesizes everything into an actionable verdict.

Strategic prioritization:

> orchestrator: we have three candidate features for next quarter: plugin marketplace, offline mode, and admin audit logging. For each, run analyst for effort and risk, roadmap to score with RICE and KANO, security for compliance implications, and devops for operational burden. Then independent-thinker to argue which one we will most regret skipping. Then high-level-advisor to rank all three with a clear recommendation.

The orchestrator runs the same evaluation pipeline across all candidates, producing comparable data for a defensible quarterly plan.

## Lifecycle Commands

Six slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right agents and quality gates automatically.

```text
  DEFINE          PLAN           BUILD          VERIFY         REVIEW          SHIP
 ┌──────┐      ┌──────┐      ┌──────┐      ┌──────┐      ┌──────┐      ┌──────┐
 │ Idea │ ───> │ Spec │ ───> │ Code │ ───> │ Test │ ───> │  QA  │ ───> │  Go  │
 │Refine│      │  PRD │      │ Impl │      │Debug │      │ Gate │      │ Live │
 └──────┘      └──────┘      └──────┘      └──────┘      └──────┘      └──────┘
  /spec          /plan          /build        /test         /review       /ship
```

| What you're doing | Command | What happens |
|-------------------|---------|--------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | CVA analysis, testable acceptance criteria, critic review |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Milestones, atomic tasks (S/M/L), dependency graph, risk register |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | TDD slices, atomic commits, code quality scoring |
| Prove it works | `/test` | 6 quality gates (functional, security, DevOps, DX, observability) |
| Review before merge | `/review` | 5-axis review (architecture, security, quality, tests, standards) |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Pre-flight checks, PR creation, ship report |

Each command chains to the next. Output from `/spec` feeds into `/plan`, which feeds into `/build`, and so on. You can also jump in at any point for smaller tasks.

**Standard feature:**

```text
/spec Add OAuth2 login flow with JWT tokens
/plan
/build
/test
/review
/ship
```

**Quick fix:**

```text
/build Fix null reference in UserService.GetById
/test
/ship
```

See [docs/workflow-commands.md](docs/workflow-commands.md) for the full command reference.

## System Architecture

### How Agents Work Together

The orchestrator coordinates specialized agents through explicit handoffs. Each agent focuses on its domain, and the orchestrator synthesizes results.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User([User]) --> Orchestrator
    
    subgraph Planning
        Orchestrator --> Analyst
        Orchestrator --> Architect
        Orchestrator --> Planner[Milestone Planner]
    end
    
    subgraph Implementation
        Orchestrator --> Implementer
        Implementer --> Code[Code + Tests]
    end
    
    subgraph Quality
        Orchestrator --> QA
        Orchestrator --> Security
        Orchestrator --> Critic
    end
    
    Code --> QA
    QA --> |pass| Done([Done])
    QA --> |fail| Implementer
    Critic --> |approve| Done
    Critic --> |reject| Implementer
```

**Typical flow:**

1. **User** describes a task to the **Orchestrator**
2. **Orchestrator** routes to **Analyst** for research and feasibility
3. **Architect** designs the solution; **Milestone Planner** breaks it into work packages
4. **Implementer** writes code and tests
5. **QA** and **Security** validate; **Critic** stress-tests the approach
6. On approval, work is complete; on failure, it loops back for fixes

### Agent Catalog

|-------|---------|--------|
| **orchestrator** | Task coordination and routing | Delegated results from specialists |
| **analyst** | Research, feasibility analysis, trade-off evaluation | Quantitative findings with evidence |

## Additional Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent not responding or not found</strong></summary>

- **Restart your editor** after installation to reload agent definitions
- Verify installation with the [Verify Installation](#verify-installation) commands
- Check that you're using the correct syntax for your platform (`Task()` for Claude, `@agent` for VS Code)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>/install-plugin command not recognized</strong></summary>

- Ensure you're running inside **Claude Code CLI** or **GitHub Copilot CLI**, not a regular terminal
- The command is built into the AI tool, not your shell
- Alternative: Use the [skill-installer method](#alternative-install-via-skill-installer)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Python version errors when running tests</strong></summary>

- This project requires **Python 3.14.x** for development
- The `.python-version` file pins the exact version (currently 3.14.3)
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites) for detailed setup

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>skill-installer TUI not launching</strong></summary>

- Ensure [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is installed: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Try the direct uvx command: `uvx --from git+https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer skill-installer interactive`
- Check Python version: requires 3.10+

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>skill-installer clone fails with short name (e.g., <code>rjmurillo/skill-installer</code>)</strong></summary>

- Pass the **full GitHub URL** to `uvx --from`, not the shorthand `owner/repo` form
- Correct: `uvx --from git+https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer skill-installer interactive`
- Incorrect: `uvx --from rjmurillo/skill-installer skill-installer interactive`
- `uvx` resolves `git+<url>` specifiers; bare `owner/repo` is not a valid source

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Orchestrator not routing to agents correctly</strong></summary>

- Be explicit: prefix prompts with the agent name (e.g., `analyst: ...`)
- Check that agents were installed for your specific platform
- Review [Quick Start examples](#examples) for correct syntax

</details>
