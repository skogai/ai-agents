"""Regression coverage for Issue #2343: pre-push must agree with build_all.py --check.

The pre-push hook used to invoke two PowerShell scripts (``build/Generate-Agents.ps1``
and ``build/scripts/Detect-AgentDrift.ps1``) that were expunged in commit
7b8347da (ADR-042 Python migration). In any worktree where pwsh is not available
or the .ps1 file is absent, the hook printed ``SKIP: Agent generation (script
not found)`` while ``build/scripts/build_all.py --check`` -- which is the
authoritative gate per the issue -- passed cleanly. This disagreement is the
exact symptom Issue #2343 calls out from PR #2340 autofix.

These tests pin the script-content contract so the divergence cannot regress.
