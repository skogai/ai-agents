"""Static-parser tests for the SPEC-005 BundleRegistry.

Each test verifies that the corresponding command markdown file at
``.claude/commands/<file>`` contains both:

1. The literal ``Skill(skill="<name>")`` invocation, and
2. An adjacent ``BUNDLE: <command-base> -> <name>`` marker.

These are static contract checks. The tests do NOT execute the
commands; they parse the markdown text only. Rows for not-yet-edited
commands carry ``@pytest.mark.xfail`` so CI stays GREEN throughout
M1 and M2 (per the SPEC-005 implementation plan §"M1 Stays Green").

The xfail marks are removed milestone-by-milestone:

- M2 closing commits remove xfail for spec.md, ship.md, plan.md,
  pr-review.md, research.md.
- M3 closing commit removes xfail for build.md, test.md, review.md.
