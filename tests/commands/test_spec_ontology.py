"""Contract tests for the ontology elicitation step in the /spec pipeline.

Tests the safe #1925 ontology slice: the /spec pipeline must elicit a domain
ontology before requirements are written, carry the OntologyFragment into the
spec-generator PRD contract, and fold an ontology-coverage check into the
completeness gate without adding a new verdict token.

These tests are structural, not behavioral. The contract is consumed by an
LLM-driven agent (the /spec command, the spec-generator skill, the
completeness-check prompt), not by code. Structural verification asserts the
contract fragments are present and well-formed and that the documented
boundaries hold:

- The ontology step is a SUB-STEP of Step 1, not a new top-level step. Step 0
  First Principles already owns the front of the pipeline, and renumbering the
  ordered Steps 1-9 (which reference each other by number) is forbidden by the
  issue's scope notes.
- The completeness check folds ontology coverage into PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL and
  MUST NOT introduce a new top-level verdict token without a coordinated
  `.github/actions/ai-review/action.yml` allowlist update.
- Empty-entity features degrade gracefully with no spurious FAIL.

The Claude canonical sources are tested. The Copilot twins are generated from
them by `build/scripts/generate_skills.py` / `build/scripts/generate_commands.py`;
their drift is guarded by `test_lifecycle_command_drift.py` and the build pipeline.
