"""Parser-side implementation of REQ-017 Step 0.5 Memory-First Gate.

Refs #1951. Used by `tests/commands/test_spec_step0_5.py`. Implements the
ProvisionalTier computation defined in REQ-017 AC-02 as Python so the
gate can be exercised deterministically without an LLM session.

The parser reads spec.md to extract Step 0.5 sections by stable heading
anchors (not line offsets) so prose churn within a section does not
break the tests. It is NOT a replacement for the model-level enforcement:
the gate at runtime is enforced by the LLM following the spec.md
instructions. This parser exists so tests can pin behavior at CI time.

Public symbols:

- `compute_provisional_tier(q4_text, entity_count)`: returns int 1-5
- `extract_step0_5_block(spec_text)`: full Step 0.5 markdown block
- `extract_step0_5_subsection(spec_text, heading)`: one named subsection
- `extract_step9_block(spec_text)`: Step 9 full block (for 9d checks)
- `has_guard_string(spec_text)`: True if partial-M2 guard is present

The parser deliberately avoids regex-anchored line numbers; section
boundaries use the next sibling heading at the same depth.
