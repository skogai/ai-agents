"""Tests for the Co-change checklist template in .claude/commands/spec.md.

Pins REQ-012-04 and REQ-012-05: Step 6 of the /spec command must include
a `## Co-change checklist` template that the spec-generator emits when
the requirement touches a shared token at more than one site. The
template exists to prevent the PR #1965 verdict-token cascade (3 commits
per token, discovered one site at a time through bot review).

The test is structural, not behavioral. The template is consumed by an
LLM-driven agent (spec-generator), not by code. Structural verification
asserts the template fragments are present and well-formed; behavioral
checks for emitted REQ-NNN files belong in spec-generator's own test
suite.
