"""Drift guards for the lifecycle command files.

Refs #1926. These tests catch the configuration drift pattern that
surfaces when a new lifecycle command is added without updating the
two parallel exclusion lists in `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml` and
`.githooks/pre-commit`.

A "lifecycle command" is a `.claude/commands/<name>.md` file whose body
opens with `@CLAUDE.md` (the marker that distinguishes lifecycle slash-
commands from ordinary command files). Lifecycle commands have YAML
frontmatter + `@CLAUDE.md` body shape with no H1 heading and no
Triggers/Verification sections. They are excluded from markdownlint
MD041 and SkillForge structural validation.

The canonical set is derived from the filesystem at test time, so adding
a new lifecycle command (a new file under `.claude/commands/` whose body
starts with `@CLAUDE.md`) automatically extends the drift checks. The
test set is no longer a hand-maintained constant.
