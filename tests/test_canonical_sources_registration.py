"""Regression tests for code-quality and code-review-norms canonical sources.

Issue #1863 registered two harness-neutral canonical sources:

- ``.agents/governance/code-quality.md``
- ``.agents/governance/code-review-norms.md``

Both are listed in the ``.gemini/styleguide.md`` Canonical Sources table and
referenced from ``.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md``. These tests pin that
contract so a future edit cannot silently drop a canonical file, point the
routing table at a path that does not exist, or move the canonical files under a
harness-scoped tree (``.claude/``, ``.github/instructions/``).
