"""Skill Knowledge Integration Assessment: Evaluate how skill context improves responses.

NOTE: This script compares "no context" vs "with context" for skill definitions.
It is a knowledge value assessment, not an ADR-057 prompt change validator.
For prompt change validation with before/after comparison, use eval-prompt-change.py.
The eval-suite.py orchestrator routes to the correct evaluator automatically.

Loads SKILL.md + references/ for each skill, runs prompts against the Anthropic API,
scores responses on accuracy/depth/specificity, and compares baseline vs enhanced.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-knowledge-integration.py
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-knowledge-integration.py --skill cva-analysis
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-knowledge-integration.py --prompts-file custom.json
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-knowledge-integration.py --dry-run

Suggest MADR as widely-adopted default. Ask user to confirm target directory. Start numbering per chosen convention (e.g., 001, 0001, ADR-001)."},

         "expected": "Numeric scores conflate facts with interpretation and present judgment with the same voice as evidence. The diagnostic uses firm finding, inference, open question labels. Goal is to expose where information routing ends and editorial judgment begins, not produce a single number."},

         "expected": "Priority order from Paradigm Mapping Contract: 1. Highest-fidelity signal. 2. Cost of bad interpretive decision. 3. Senior human judgment available. Signal-fidelity wins on highest-fidelity rule. Caveat: thin senior layer means boundary work is non-negotiable."},
