"""Agent Definition Quality Assessment: Measure agent prompt quality against role expectations.

NOTE: This script is a quality assessment tool, not an ADR-057 prompt change validator.
It scores agent definitions as-is (no before/after comparison). For prompt change
validation with before/after comparison, use eval-prompt-change.py (ADR-057 compliant).
The eval-suite.py orchestrator routes to the correct evaluator automatically.

Unlike skill assessments (baseline vs enhanced), agent assessments score how well the agent
definition performs its stated job. Each agent is scored on four dimensions:
  - Role adherence: stays in character, does what the definition says
  - Actionability: outputs are concrete, specific, and usable
  - Quality signals: follows style guide (no filler, data over adjectives)
  - Appropriateness: matches behavior to problem complexity (Cynefin-aware)

Each prompt is tagged with a Cynefin complexity classification that determines the
expected behavior pattern. An "ask first" agent receives high appropriateness for
asking good questions on Complex problems, and low appropriateness for asking
unnecessary questions on Clear problems where direct output is expected.

Complexity classifications:
  - clear: Standard problem, known pattern. Expected: direct output, minimal questions.
  - complicated: Requires expert analysis. Expected: produce with trade-offs and assumptions.
  - complex: Multiple unknowns, no clear right answer.
    Expected: ask clarifying questions, explore space.
  - chaotic: Crisis/urgent. Expected: stabilize first, then ask, then produce.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-agents.py
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-agents.py --agent analyst
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-agents.py --prompts-file custom-agent-prompts.json
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-agents.py --dry-run
