"""RunPersistence: idempotent JSONL writer for eval-agent-vs-baseline.

DESIGN-004 §5.5, REQ-004 AC-9. Records are appended one per line to
`runs.jsonl` under `evals/security-spike/runs/<RUN_ID>/`. The
`(fixture_id, variant, run_index)` triple is the idempotency key.

Two modes (DESIGN-004 §Failure Modes):
- **Fresh-run**: opening an already-populated `runs.jsonl` raises
  `RunDirectoryNotFreshError`. Any later collision in the loop raises
  `DuplicateRunError`. An unsupported `schemaVersion` raises
  `SchemaVersionError`. A `runs.jsonl` line that does not parse, or
  parses but lacks an identity field, raises
  `MalformedRunRecordError`. The runner maps `DuplicateRunError` to
  exit 1 (logic) and `SchemaVersionError` plus
  `MalformedRunRecordError` to exit 2 (config) per AGENTS.md
  exit-code contract and DESIGN-004 §Failure Modes.
- **Resume**: existing records are loaded; `is_completed(...)` reports
  True only for triples whose prior record was `outcome="success"`.
  Errored triples are retried by default. The writer skips silently
  when the same successful triple is asked to write a second time.

Atomic write: each append happens via write-temp-then-rename of the
JSONL file (small, append-only) to avoid partial lines when the process
is interrupted between bytes.
