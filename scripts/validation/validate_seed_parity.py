"""Forensic tool: was a canonical review-axis hand-paraphrased or verbatim-seeded?

This is a FORENSIC TOOL, not a regression gate. Do NOT add it to CI.

Background. REQ-008-01 mandated that each canonical
``.claude/skills/review/references/{role}.md`` was seeded verbatim from the matching
``.github/prompts/pr-quality-gate-{role}.md`` at the seeding commit on
the main branch. The seed transform adds YAML frontmatter, balances any
unclosed code fence, and appends an ``## Output Schema`` section. The
underlying body must round-trip: SHA-256 of the canonical body (minus
those additions) must equal SHA-256 of the CI prompt body on main.

What this script does. Compares those two SHA-256 values per role and
reports parity. Useful when a maintainer is investigating whether a
specific canonical file was hand-paraphrased after the seed event
(rather than copy-pasted character-for-character).

When this script will FAIL by design. Once a maintainer intentionally
edits the canonical body (and the canonical IS the system of record),
the script will report a mismatch. That is expected. PR #1965 already
amended canonical files for vendored-install survival, UNKNOWN
handling, and severity-token alignment, so on the post-merge tree the
script will not pass. Treat a non-zero exit as evidence of intentional
divergence, not a regression. PR #1965 critic Finding 6 + copilot 6l8V.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/validation/validate_seed_parity.py        # all 6 roles
    python3 scripts/validation/validate_seed_parity.py analyst architect

Exit codes (per ADR-035):
    0  Canonical body and CI prompt body match (verbatim seed intact).
    1  Mismatch (canonical was edited after seed, or never seeded
       verbatim). NOT a regression on a post-#1934 tree.
    2  Configuration error (missing canonical, missing CI prompt source
       on main, or git unavailable). Always a real problem.
