"""Shared infrastructure for the pre-PR validation check modules.

Extracted from ``scripts/validation/pre_pr.py`` (issue #2223) so the pre-PR
runner stays under the file-size limit and the area-specific check modules
(``checks_tooling``, ``checks_dash``, ``checks_spec``, ``checks_plugin``,
``checks_coverage``) share one home for the subprocess wrapper, the
SKIP control-flow signal, and the git base-ref resolution helpers.

This began as a behavior-preserving move from ``pre_pr.py``. Later fixes can
land in these extracted modules directly while ``pre_pr`` re-exports them so
``from scripts.validation.pre_pr import MissingScriptSkip`` and the rest keep
working for existing callers and tests.
