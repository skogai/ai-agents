"""Plugin, install, and hook gates for the pre-PR runner.

Extracted from ``scripts/validation/pre_pr.py`` (issue #2223). Groups the
checks that guard install-copy parity, the plugin.json version bump, hook
anchoring, local git-hooks installation, and the shift-left workflow local-run.

This began as a behavior-preserving move from ``pre_pr.py``. Later fixes can
land in this extracted module directly while ``pre_pr`` re-exports these names
so existing imports keep working.

    Skipped under CI: a CI checkout neither has nor should have

    not local hooks), so the check is irrelevant there.

    the gate to run in worktrees to catch shared drift; this narrows that to a
