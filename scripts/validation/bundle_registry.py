"""Single source of truth for SPEC-005 BundleRegistry.

The registry enumerates which dedicated skills are bundled into which
lifecycle command markdown files. It is consumed by:

- ``tests/test_command_bundles.py`` (static-parser test, parametrized)
- ``scripts/validation/pre_pr.py`` (advisory WARN check, gated behind
  ``BUNDLE_CHECK_ENFORCED`` env var; default ``0``)

Both consumers MUST import from this module to avoid copy-paste drift
(per SPEC-005 plan adversarial review C5 and pre-mortem F5).

The registry has 15 entries across 13 unique skills (some skills
appear in more than one command). See:

- ``.agents/specs/requirements/REQ-005-command-skill-bundling.md``
- ``.agents/specs/design/DESIGN-005-command-skill-bundling.md``
- ``.agents/specs/tasks/TASK-005-command-skill-bundling.md``
