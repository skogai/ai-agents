"""Static check that ``.claude/commands/build.md`` wires the required exit gates.

The /build command is the implementer's exit path. Layer 2 of the PR #1887
retrospective (`.agents/retrospective/2026-05-05-pr-1887-iteration-paradox.md`)
named the failure mode: existing skills (code-qualities-assessment,
taste-lints, doc-accuracy) were invoke-on-demand and not on the exit path,
so review-time bots flagged what they should have caught.

This validator pins the contract: any future edit that drops one of the
three exit gates from ``.claude/commands/build.md`` fails CI before merge,
not after. It is intentionally a small surface area; it does not validate
that the gates *run* (the implementer does that), only that they are
listed as required invocations.

EXIT CODES (`AGENTS.md`, ADR-035):
  0 - All required gates present.
  1 - One or more required gates missing.
  2 - Configuration error (build.md missing or unreadable).
